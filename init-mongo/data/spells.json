A _geas_ to perform an act is usually conditional, such as, \"Always offer hospitality to strangers seeking a place to stay.\" An unconditional _geas_ to perform a certain act doesn't require the target to perform that act exclusively, though it must prioritize the task above all leisurely pursuits. The most common _geas_ to refrain from carrying out an act is a specification to avoid violating a contract. In those cases, the secondary caster usually takes charge of making sure the wording of the contract is attuned correctly with the ritual's magic. Because the target is willing, _geas_ can have a duration that lasts for as long as the target agrees to. If the target is unable to fulfill the _geas_, it becomes Sickened{Sickened 1}, and the sickened condition increases by 1 for each consecutive day it is prevented from following the _geas_, to a maximum of sickened 4. The sickened condition ends immediately when it follows the _geas_ again; it can't remove the sickened condition in any other way. Only powerful magic such as a Wish ritual can remove the effects of _geas_ from a willing target.\n\n**Critical Success** The _geas_ succeeds, and the target receives a +1 status bonus to skill checks that directly uphold the _geas_ (at the GM's discretion).\n\n**Success** The _geas_ succeeds.\n\n**Failure** The _geas_ fails.\n\n**Critical Failure** The _geas_ fails, and you are instead affected by the _geas_ you were attempting to place on the target.

You choose the type of damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) when you Cast the Spell. The shadow uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. The shadow doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The shadow can't make any attacks other than its Strike.\n\nThe shadow vanishes if the target ceases to cast a shadow (usually if it moves into complete darkness or light).

The damage type is the same as the chosen weapon (or any of its types for a versatile weapon). The attack deals spirit damage instead if that would be more detrimental to the creature (as determined by the GM). This attack uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty.\n*   **Protect** The guardian protects a creature of your choice.

This gives it the minion trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you command it, and commanding it is a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits. You can have a maximum of four minions under your control. If it doesn't become a minion, you can give it one simple command. It pursues that goal single-mindedly, ignoring any of your subsequent commands.\n\n**Success** As critical success, except an animated object that doesn't become your minion stays in place and attacks anyone that attacks it or tries to steal or move it, rather than following your command.\n\n**Failure** You fail to create the animated object.\n\n**Critical Failure** You create the animated object, but it goes berserk and attempts to destroy you.\n\nCreatures Creation Rituals\n--------------------------\n\nCreature Level\n\nSpell Rank Required\n\nCost\n\n\\-1 or 0\n\n2\n\n15 gp\n\n1\n\n2\n\n60 gp\n\n2\n\n3\n\n105 gp\n\n3\n\n3\n\n180 gp\n\n4\n\n4\n\n300 gp\n\n5\n\n4\n\n480 gp\n\n6\n\n5\n\n750 gp\n\n7\n\n5\n\n1,080 gp\n\n8\n\n6\n\n1,500 gp\n\n9\n\n6\n\n2,100 gp\n\n10\n\n7\n\n3,000 gp\n\n11\n\n7\n\n4,200 gp\n\n12\n\n8\n\n6,000 gp\n\n13\n\n8\n\n9,000 gp\n\n14\n\n9\n\n13,500 gp\n\n15\n\n9\n\n19,500 gp\n\n16\n\n10\n\n30,000 gp\n\n17\n\n10\n\n45,000 gp",

A creature that doesn't wish to negotiate at all can attempt a Will save to stay on its home plane. Most extraplanar creatures feel that they have something better to do than cater to the whims of mortals and require a significant gift, especially if your task poses major risks. Fiends and similarly wicked extraplanar creatures are more likely to accept a bargain for a lower cost as long as it allows them to wreak havoc on the Universe or inflict evil upon the world along the way.\n\nMonetary prices usually range from the cost of a consumable item of the creature's level for a short and simple task to a permanent magic item of the creature's level or more to persuade the creature to fight alongside you. However, some extraplanar creatures may want payments other than money, such as permission to cast a Geas on you to fulfill an unspecified later favor or obtain ownership of your soul via an infernal contract.\n\nYou can add an additional secondary caster to create a warding circle that prevents the extraplanar creature from attacking or leaving the circle during the bargain. This uses the Crafting skill and has the same DC as a secondary check would. This protection ends if you use a hostile action against the extraplanar creature or the warding circle breaks.\n\n**Critical Success** You call the extraplanar creature and can prevent it from returning home for up to a full day, potentially allowing you to negotiate a better deal by threatening to leave it in the wards for the duration.\n\n**Success** You call the extraplanar creature and must make your case succinctly, after which the creature can return home at any time.\n\n**Failure** You fail to call the extraplanar creature.\n\n**Critical Failure** You call something vile and horrible, unbound by your wards, and it immediately attempts to destroy you.",

While within the area, worshippers of your deity gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and Perception checks, and creatures anathema to your deity (such as undead for Pharasma or Sarenrae) take a -1 status penalty to those rolls. If your deity’s divine sanctification allows you to choose holy or unholy, you can choose to make the consecrated site holy or unholy as well. If the deity’s sanctification must be holy or unholy, you must make the site match that sanctification. [Strikes](link_action_20926) made by worshippers of your deity within the area gain the site's sanctification trait, if any.\n\n**Critical Success** The consecration succeeds, and it either lasts for 10 years instead of 1 or covers an area with twice the radius. Occasionally, with your deity's favor, this might produce an even more amazing effect, such as a permanently consecrated area or the effect covering an entire cathedral.\n\n**Success** The consecration succeeds.\n\n**Failure** The consecration fails.\n\n**Critical Failure** The consecration fails spectacularly and angers your deity, who sends a sign of displeasure. For at least 1 year, further attempts to consecrate the site fail.",

Some forms of undead, such as liches, form using their own unique methods and can't be created with a version of _create undead_.\n\n**Critical Success** The target becomes an undead creature of the appropriate type. If it's at least 4 levels lower than you, you can make it a minion. This gives it the minion trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you command it, and commanding it is a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits. You can have a maximum of four minions under your control. If it's intelligent and doesn't become a minion, the undead is helpful to you for awakening it, though it's still a horrid and evil creature. If it's unintelligent and doesn't become a minion, you can give it one simple command. It pursues that goal single-mindedly, ignoring any of your subsequent commands.\n\n**Success** As critical success, except an intelligent undead that doesn't become your minion is only friendly to you, and an unintelligent undead that doesn't become your minion leaves you alone unless you attack it. It marauds the local area rather than following your command.\n\n**Failure** You fail to create the undead.\n\n**Critical Failure** You create the undead, but its soul, tortured by your foul necromancy, is full of nothing but hatred for you. It attempts to destroy you.\n\nCreatures Creation Rituals\n--------------------------\n\n| Creature Level | Spell Rank Required | Cost |\n\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n| -1 or 0 | 2 | 15 gp |\n\n| 1 | 2 | 60 gp |\n\n| 2 | 3 | 105 gp |\n\n| 3 | 3 | 180 gp |\n\n| 4 | 4 | 300 gp |\n\n| 5 | 4 | 480 gp |\n\n| 6 | 5 | 750 gp |\n\n| 7 | 5 | 1,080 gp |\n\n| 8 | 6 | 1,500 gp |\n\n| 9 | 6 | 2,100 gp |\n\n| 10 | 7 | 3,000 gp |\n\n| 11 | 7 | 4,200 gp |\n\n| 12 | 8 | 6,000 gp |\n\n| 13 | 8 | 9,000 gp |\n\n| 14 | 9 | 13,500 gp |\n\n| 15 | 9 | 19,500 gp |\n\n| 16 | 10 | 30,000 gp |\n\n| 17 | 10 | 45,000 gp |",

Your offerings should align with the personal tastes of the deity.\n\nYou can alternatively name a being native to the deity's realm that you know personally, with the same level restriction. Such a creature might request something they personally want as payment.\n\n**Critical Success** The deity sends a servitor, and the servitor's payment costs only half as much as normal. If you ask for a particular servitor by name, the deity is likely to send that servitor unless the servitor is busy.\n\n**Success** Your deity sends a servitor.\n\n**Failure** Your deity does not send a servitor.\n\n**Critical Failure** The deity is offended and sends a sign of displeasure or possibly even a servitor to scold or attack you, depending on your deity's nature.

The GM might decide a wish draws the attention of deities or other powerful creatures, leading to interference with the ritual or attempts to undo the wish. The power of the ritual alters reality to such a degree that even deities can't outright undo the wish, but they can react to the wish by sending servitors to take away the newly acquired riches, for example.\n\n**Critical Success** The wish is granted without complication or drawbacks.\n\n**Success** The wish is granted, but with unintended consequences or side effects, such as taking riches from a well-known criminal, stirring a damaged kingdom to war, or angering rival gods.\n\n**Failure** The wish fails and has no result. The GM can instead have the wish be partially granted, but to such a lesser degree that the target will be eternally unsatisfied.\n\n**Critical Failure** The wish is corrupted, resulting in a cruel fulfillment.

If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends.\n\nThe image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.\n\nIn combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you [Sustain the spell](link_action_20948). It uses your spell attack modifier for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC – 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.\n\nThe illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes 3d4 mental damage. The illusion's [Strikes](link_action_20926) are [nonlethal](link_trait_1571). If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster—for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage—the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.\n\nAny creature that touches the image or uses the [Seek](link_action_19845) action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it.",

If it's the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a random location on the plane. _Interplanar teleport_ doesn't provide a means of return travel, though casting _interplanar teleport_ again allows you to return to your previous plane unless there are extenuating circumstances.",

        "description": "**Secondary Casters** 6\n\n**Primary Check** Arcana (legendary) or Occultism (legendary);\n\n**Secondary Checks** Crafting, Society\n\n* * *\n\nYou perform a ritual to imprison a creature in one of several forms. While some versions of this ritual offer all of the forms, others include only a single form or only a few of them. Whichever form you use, the effect can’t be [counteracted](link_action_27519), though it can be ended by [_freedom_](link_spell_6269). Some forms of _imprisonment_ can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.\n\n*   **Chains** You bind the creature with chains, rendering it unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 × the _imprisonment_ ritual’s spell level, and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.\n    \n*   **Object (9th rank or higher)** You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a gem, jar, bottle, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn’t require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can’t use any other actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it. This form of _imprisonment_ is also [polymorph](link_trait_1453) [magic](link_trait_1504).\n    \n*   **Oubliette (10th rank only)** You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can’t be reached by any means. You also prevent [predictions](link_trait_1896) from revealing the location where the _imprisonment_ occurred. Powerful [magic](link_trait_1504) such as [_wish_](link_spell_4955) can reveal the location of the imprisonment, but even such [magic](link_trait_1504) can’t free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-rank [_freedom_](link_spell_6269) ritual can do so.\n    \n*   **Prison** You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The [magic](link_trait_1504) also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature’s prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.\n    \n*   **Slumber (**[**sleep**](link_trait_1650) **effect)** You put the creature into an eternal [sleep](link_trait_1650). It ceases aging and doesn’t require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target—whether romantically, filially, or otherwise—frees it from the slumber. This form of _imprisonment_ is also [mental](link_trait_1448) [magic](link_trait_1504).\n    \n*   **Temporal Stasis** You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn’t grow older and can’t be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of _imprisonment_, temporal stasis can be [counteracted](link_action_27519) by a [_dispel magic_](link_spell_4572) or [_haste_](link_spell_4654) spell. This form of _imprisonment_ is also [polymorph](link_trait_1453) [magic](link_trait_1504).\n    \n\n**Critical Success** You imprison the target. You can either use a form of _imprisonment_ that usually requires 1 additional spell rank, or give any creatures trying to use a [_freedom_](link_spell_6269) ritual to rescue the target a –2 circumstance penalty to checks associated with that ritual.\n\n**Success** You imprison the target.\n\n**Failure** You fail to imprison the target.\n\n**Critical Failure** You imprison yourself and the secondary casters in the same way you intended to imprison the target.",

If the creature is entirely unable to fulfill the action it committed to—for instance, if it had only 1 action left and Amiri was out of the range of its jaws [Strike](link_action_19856)—it loses the last action of its turn as it reels in a temporal paradox. The creature can choose to lock in a 2- or 3-action activity if it prefers to do so, but if it does, it loses all the associated actions if it can't perform the activity on its turn. If the situation changes oddly (perhaps the creature is forcibly teleported away and has no idea which direction is “toward Valeros” any longer), the GM determines what happens.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the creature must commit at least two of its actions for the next turn—“I will [Stride](link_action_19855) toward Valeros and then [Strike](link_action_19856) with my claws.” All of these actions are similarly locked in and can't be changed, but the creature can take them in any order.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature must commit all of its actions for the next turn.",

The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you and repeats a basic single action the target took since the end of your last turn, such as making a [Strike](link_action_19856) or [Interacting](link_action_19733) to pull a lever. Because the other basic single actions don't produce much of a result on their own, this is typically used for [Strike](link_action_19856) and [Interact](link_action_19733), though occasionally it could be useful to have a _temporal twin_ [Stride](link_action_19855) through a potentially dangerous area to expose a hazard. The target ally spends a reaction to create the duplicate, makes any decisions, and rolls for the repeated action, such as choosing a target for a [Strike](link_action_19856) and making the attack roll. If the ally doesn't have a reaction to spend, _temporal twin_ fails. Use the duplicate's location for determining flanking, cover, and the like. Using this spell requires remembering what your ally did, and if you don't remember the details, the GM might not allow you to cast _temporal twin_.\n\nThis action can't be used for anything but a basic single action, nor can it use limited resources. The action can have a different target than the original action but must be very similar in form. For example, if the original action were to [Interact](link_action_19733) to pull a lever, the time duplicate could pull a different lever, but couldn't turn a doorknob or pick up an item from a table.\n\nBeing pulled through time to create a twin destabilizes the target's timeline. Once an ally has been the target of _temporal twin_, they're temporarily immune for 1 day.",

You can also make one attempt to [Steal](link_action_19852) as part of [Casting](link_action_19611) _umbral graft_. If you succeed at your check to [Steal](link_action_19852) a spell, randomly determine a spell affecting the foe that has a target entry. That spell ceases to affect the target, and you can either cause the spell to affect you or store it in your shadow. If your attempt to [Steal](link_action_19852) was a critical success, you automatically steal the spell if its rank is equal to or lower than _umbral graft_. If it was a success, you automatically steal it if its rank is lower than _umbral graft_. If you succeeded, but the spell's rank was too high to steal automatically, you must attempt a counteract check to see if you steal the spell. You know what the spell is as soon as you steal it. If you store it, you can transfer it to a willing creature as a single action that has the [manipulate](link_trait_1433) trait. The spell lasts for its remaining duration, to a maximum of 1 minute, and any time you keep it stored subtracts from its duration normally. The spell gains the [shadow](link_trait_1901) trait.\n\nYou can't steal constant innate spells that are always active on a creature, such as a choral angel's constant [_tongues_](link_spell_4913), or innate spells that have special restrictions that remove their ability to target other creatures, such as an imp's [_invisibility_](link_spell_4689).

The target can [Interact](link_action_19733) three times in a row to spit out the entire contents of its extradimensional storage; the target doesn't have to take these actions all in the same turn, but if it takes any other actions in between, it has to start over. The items eject into the target's space, possibly spilling out into adjacent spaces if there is too much to fit.\n\nWhen the spell ends or the target falls unconscious, the contents of the extradimensional storage are disgorged in a riotous spew, landing in the nearest unoccupied space, a bit wet but otherwise unharmed.",

The losers of the bet are placed under the effects of a 9th-rank geas ritual to uphold the promise or turn over a single item they own, as stated at the time of the spell's casting. Once ownership has been transferred or the promise fulfilled, nothing prevents the bettors from trying to reclaim a former possession.\n*   The bettors' life.

Until this protection has been exhausted, the loser of the bet can't be returned to life through any means, even powerful magic such as wish. A creature already in possession of an additional life as a result of winning an Asmodean wager can't enter into a new wager with a life as collateral.\n\nIf any participant knowingly and willingly makes any attempt to cheat at or avoid fulfilling the terms of the wager, the spell automatically determines them the loser and resolves accordingly. The spell doesn't function if any participant is acting against their will or being mentally controlled or coerced by any means, or if any participant is immune to or otherwise unaffected by their wager (such as if a construct, undead, or other creature immune to death effects tried to bet its life). At the GM's discretion, if it ever becomes permanently impossible for the bet's outcome to be determined, the spell ends without any further result.\n\n**Success** The ritual is successful.\n\n**Failure** The ritual has no effect.\n\n**Critical Failure** The wording of the ritual is imperfect and subverts the bet, causing all bettors to be considered losers regardless of the actual result of the wager.",

If you're Medium, you require 30 gallons of blood to immerse yourself, and a typical Medium creature holds about 1-1/2 gallons of blood in its body. This ritual doesn't strictly require that the blood donors be killed and drained dry, but the logistical challenges of gathering enough blood without murder are beyond all but the most well-resourced casters.\n\nEach time you enact this ritual, regardless of its success or failure, you take a penalty to the primary check for all subsequent castings. This penalty starts at -1 and increases by -1 during each casting (so if you were casting this ritual on yourself for the fifth time, you would take a -4 penalty on your Occultism check).\n\n**Critical Success** You emerge rejuvenated and revived.

The hand has an AC of 25, 50 Hit Points, and can't recover HP by any means. A hit by a _disintegrate_ spell or similar effect destroys the hand.\n\nThe hand's actions and the cover it provides depend on what actions you take during your turn. At the end of your turn, what the hand does is determined by the first entry on this list that matches a trait from any of the actions you used on your turn.

The targets of this spell are the fated opponents: one of the targets of this spell must be you or a willing ally, and the other must be an enemy.\n\nWhen you Cast the Spell, the ally you targeted (or you, if you targeted yourself) may teleport to any unoccupied space of their choice within 30 feet of its fated opponent. This is a teleportation effect.\n\nYou isolate the two targets for 1 round. During this time, fate refuses to allow either fated opponent to be affected by attacks or effects from a third party; a fated opponent could be affected by the other's _meteor swarm_ or its own _heal_ spell, but it would be entirely immune to a spell or Strike from a creature outside of the spells effects, as well including damage from a hazard or the environment. This doesn't apply to anything that was affecting the targets before you cast fated confrontation (such as a spell with a duration or persistent damage the creature had before it was affected by _fated confrontation_). For the duration of the spell, either fated opponent can manipulate fate once on each of its turns. This allows it to either roll twice and take the higher result on an attack roll or skill check it makes against its fated opponent (a fortune effect), or force the fated opponent to roll twice on a saving throw against one of its abilities and take the lower result (a misfortune effect).\n\nThis spell ends if either target becomes unable to act, or if they both agree to cease hostilities.",

It has a Speed of 60 feet, AC of 14, Fortitude saving throw modifier of +8, Hardness 5, 100 Hit Points (BT 50), object immunities, and immunities to critical hits and precision damage.\n\nOnce loaded and boarded, the mystic carriage sets out at a Speed of 60 feet, heading unerringly towards its destination using whatever roads and trails are available. If it's attacked, it continues going as long as nothing blocks its passage. If something blocks its way, living or otherwise, it will stop until the way is cleared, waiting to continue until all of its passengers are aboard once more.\n\n**Critical Success** You create a mystic carriage that lasts for 2 weeks, instead of 1 week. It can take you to up to two destinations, the first of which must be within 250 miles and the second of which must be within 250 miles of the first destination.\n\n**Success** You create a mystic carriage as described above.\n\n**Failure** You don't create a mystic carriage.\n\n**Critical Failure** You don't create a mystic carriage, and you're attacked by a herd of four riding horses.",

        "description": "This famous ritual is a sophisticated example of symbolic magic, binding fate and fortune to follow a prepared script. To conduct the ritual, you and the secondary casters must put on a long-form, multi-person, plot-based performance that's usually a play or opera, though more unusual performances have been known. You take the role of the director, while the secondary casters are either actors (Performance) or significant backstage figures, such as set or costume designers (Crafting). The casting time of the ritual includes both preparations and rehearsals of various sorts and the actual performance, which must be at least an hour long.\n\nThe performance presents current events and offers a particular vision on how they resolve, often in metaphorical or allegorical format (proposing the overthrow of a tyrant by referring to a different, legendary tyrant who was overthrown, or suggesting that a murderous secret might be uncovered by presenting an allegory of truth defeating murder). This performance must be presented to an audience of at least a hundred people, a majority of whom must both be connected, at least peripherally, to the events in question (the people of the tyrant's city, or the residents of the village where the murder occurred) and who must understand what the metaphor or allegory actually refers to. For the magic to spark, the performance must declare its purpose loudly and clearly to the parties most concerned. If a major antagonist featured in the performance is in the audience and the ritual is a success, you get a critical success instead.\n\n**Critical Success** Something sublime sparks between performance and audience, and destiny conspires to push events in the right direction. You and each secondary caster can reroll up to three skill checks at any point during the duration of the ritual after determining the results, as long as the skill check is connected to ensuring the topic of the performance comes true (to sneak past the tyrant's guards or find the murder weapon, for instance).\n\n**Success** As critical success except the sparks of destiny are weaker, so each caster can reroll only a single skill check.\n\n**Failure** The ritual has no effect.\n\n**Critical Failure** The performance is a dramatic and horrendous botch, and fate strikes out at the casters. You and each secondary caster are \\[\\[Doomed\\]\\]{Doomed 1} for the next month, and this condition can't be removed by anything less than a wish or similarly powerful magic.",

Each sensor looks where that target looks, and all the targets can link their vision briefly to help notice things one target sees but the others might not. Each target can use an action, which has the concentrate trait, to share what it sees with any number of other targets until the start of its next turn. Only one creature can share its vision at a time, so if another target takes this action, the effect ends for any target that was previously sharing its vision.\n\nThis improves how well the recipients can perceive anything the sharing creature is looking at. For instance, if a creature is undetected to a recipient but observed by the sharing creature, the creature becomes observed by the recipient as well. Typically, the creature is seen as a glowing outline superimposed on its position. This might allow the recipient to target a creature it couldn't otherwise; however, cover and line of effect still might prevent or impede targeting and attacks. This can only improve the recipient's vision, not reduce it; for example, if an enemy was undetected by the sharing creature and observed by a recipient, the recipient would still clearly observe the enemy.\n\nOnce the vision sharing stops, the benefit ends. Whether a creature is hidden or undetected is still based on the last information a target had before the vision sharing ended. For example, that means if a creature is behind a wall but hasn't moved, it's still hidden rather than undetected by a recipient that witnessed its current position.",

You can't reduce the amount of Hit Points you lose in this way. The target still takes any effects that would come with the damage, however, such as the venom on a viper's fangs [Strike](link_action_19856).",

Ultimately, the GM decides if an object or creature can be targeted with this spell.\n\nAll damage from this spell ignores Hardness. If the spell causes persistent damage from rust, a creature can attempt to scrape off the rust to assist the target in recovering from the persistent damage (reducing the DC of the flat check to end persistent damage to 10 and granting an immediate flat check). The effect of the spell depends on its target.\n\n*   **Creature or Hazard** A creature or hazard must be made of all or mostly metal to be affected (this includes many mechanical traps). The grasp deals 8d6 damage (basic Fortitude save), plus 2d6 persistent on a failed save. Touching a hazard to affect it with this spell might trigger the hazard, as determined by the GM.\n*   **Item** The rust deals \\[\\[/r {2d6}\\]\\]{2d6 damage}, subject to a basic Reflex save by the creature wearing or holding the item; if the item is unattended, it automatically gets a critical failure. On a failed save, the item also takes 1d6 persistent. For an attended item, this persistent damage occurs at the end of the attending creature's turns; if the item was unattended when you Cast the Spell, the damage happens at the end of your turns.\n    \n    When targeting armor someone is wearing, its Bulk is 1 higher than the listed value, since carrying armor is more cumbersome than wearing it.

In addition, you can obscure up to six doors, doorways, or similar entrances within the area with the effects of \\[\\[Illusory Object\\]\\] to appear as plain walls. \\[\\[Scrying\\]\\] spells can't perceive any stimuli from the area, and ward domain attempts to counteract \\[\\[Teleport\\]\\] effects into or out of the area, including attempts to summon creatures into the area, using a modifier equal to the ritual's save DC - 10.\n\nA successful \\[\\[Dispel Magic\\]\\] used on a specific effect removes only that effect (such as the lock effect on one window). A successful \\[\\[Disjunction\\]\\] ends the entire ritual.\n\n**Critical Success** You create the effects described above, and you protect an area twice as large.\n\n**Success** You create the effects described above.\n\n**Failure** The ritual has no effect.\n\n**Critical Failure** The area becomes trapped and hostile to you and your allies in a way you didn't anticipate.",

        "description": "You project the targets' spiritual essences into the Astral Plane, leaving their inanimate physical forms behind. These astral forms can be used to explore the Astral Plane indefinitely, while the targets' bodies remain safely in stasis on the plane where the ritual was cast (where they remain unconscious and can't be awoken normally). The casters must be in physical contact with one another in a circle for the duration of the casting, and all targets must be selected from these casters.\n\nA target's astral form is a duplicate of the target and everything they're carrying; anything that happens to a duplicate item happens to the original as well. For instance, if you use, spend, destroy, lose, or give away an item's duplicate, the original vanishes from your possession. For the duration of the ritual, any of the targets can spend a single action to \\[\\[Dismiss\\]\\] their astral form and immediately return to their physical body. As the primary caster, when you Dismiss your astral form, you can also Dismiss all the other targets' astral forms as part of the same action, returning all targets to their physical forms simultaneously. While in the Astral Plane, the other targets are unable to navigate without you, and if they become separated from you, they must wait for your return or Dismiss their own astral forms. When the ritual ends, the targets' astral forms vanish.\n\nA target's astral form and corresponding physical form are linked by an incorporeal silver cord, which is visible only in the Astral Plane. This nearly unbreakable cord serves as a conduit and safety line; if it is severed, the target's astral and physical forms are both immediately slain. If the ritual is interrupted by an external force, such as \\[\\[Dispel Magic\\]\\] being cast on a target's physical or astral form, the target is immediately and harmlessly returned to their physical body. If a target's astral form is slain, the silver cord immediately rips them back to their physical body; the strain requires them to attempt a Fortitude save with the same DC as the ritual's primary check. On a failure, the creature dies; on a success, they become \\[\\[Clumsy\\]\\]{Clumsy 2}, \\[\\[Drained\\]\\]{Drained 2}, \\[\\[Doomed\\]\\]{Doomed 2}, and \\[\\[Enfeebled\\]\\]{Enfeebled 2} for 1 week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed. A target's physical body remains in suspended animation for the duration of the ritual, but if it is destroyed, they die and their astral form also vanishes.\n\nThis ritual only projects a portion of the targets' consciousnesses onto the Astral Plane. To travel physically to the Astral Plane (to reach the Outer Planes, for example) requires spells such as \\[\\[Interplanar Teleport\\]\\].\n\n**Critical Success** All targets are able to navigate independently in the Astral Plane. Each target's silver cord is stronger than usual, providing them a +4 circumstance bonus to their Fortitude save to avoid dying if their astral form dies.\n\n**Success** You successfully project the targets.\n\n**Failure** You fail to project the targets.\n\n**Critical Failure** The process of separating the targets' spirits from their bodies is complicated, and something goes catastrophically wrong. All casters become \\[\\[Doomed\\]\\]{Doomed 1}, are immediately reduced to 0 Hit Points, and begin \\[\\[Dying\\]\\].",

For instance, against a simulacrum dragon's breath weapon, all creatures in the area seem to critically succeed at their saving throws and take no damage. Creatures can attempt to disbelieve the illusion by attempting a Perception check against the Deception DC of the secondary spellcaster who rolled the Deception check.\n\n**Critical Success** You bring the simulacrum to life.

If the secondary succeeds at their check at the destination and you roll a success, the ritual is a critical success instead.\n\nWhile the circle is active, any creature that moves to be fully within the circle is instantly teleported to the destination. A creature that is unwilling to be teleported can attempt a Will save to resist the effect. If it remains in the circle, the creature must attempt this save again at the end of each of its turns.\n\nThe teleportation circle normally goes only in one direction, though you can double the Cost to make the teleportation work in both directions.\n\n**Critical Success** You create the teleportation circle, and it's extremely precise, regardless of the distance traveled. Travelers arrive exactly at the designated point.\n\n**Success** As a critical success, but the destination of the teleportation circle is slightly inaccurate, and is off target by roughly 1 percent of the distance traveled, to a maximum of 10 miles off target.\n\n**Failure** The teleportation circle doesn't function.\n\n**Critical Failure** The teleportation circle is wildly inaccurate.

        "description": "Few incantations are as renowned as the power to create worlds. To cast this ritual, you must be on the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, or a plane that connects to one of the two.\n\nA demiplane created with this ritual exists on the [Astral](link_trait_2466) or [Ethereal](link_trait_2459) Plane. It can have the appearance of any mundane environment or structure, such as a glorious cathedral, a clearing in a forest, a comfortably furnished cavern, or anything else one can imagine. All demiplanes have finite, unbreachable boundaries, which might resemble stone, wood, or something more unnatural, such as a wall of mist or unceasing void.\n\nDemiplanes have environmental conditions as appropriate for the Universe, though the primary caster can dictate a general climate or light level, as well as whether the demiplane experiences seasons or a day-night cycle. The demiplane has no native plants or animals, but they can be introduced, and plants will grow in a demiplane's light.\n\nWhen you first cast create demiplane, the casters are teleported to the demiplane. The demiplane has no direct access to other worlds, so [_interplanar teleport_](link_spell_4687) or similar abilities are necessary to access it. As part of casting the ritual to create a new demiplane, you create a planar key to the demiplane which serves as an interplanar teleport locus for that demiplane. Most resemble ornate keys, but some take the forms of maps, compasses, or dowsing rods.\n\nIf you have the original key to an existing demiplane and are on that demiplane, you can instead use this ritual to either expand the demiplane or add special traits or features.\n\n*   **Bounteous** The demiplane has a functional ecosystem, with [plants](link_trait_2938) and [animals](link_trait_2409) appropriate to the environment. This ecosystem doesn't require any additional effort on your part to maintain.\n    \n*   **Elemental** The demiplane gains the [air](link_trait_1524), [earth](link_trait_1523), [fire](link_trait_1542), [metal](link_trait_2132), [water](link_trait_1584), or [wood](link_trait_1680) planar essence trait.\n    \n*   **Gravity** The demiplane gains a gravity trait of your choice.\n    \n*   **Key** You create an additional planar key that can be used to access the demiplane with [_interplanar teleport_](link_spell_4687) and improve it with _create demiplane_.\n    \n*   **Portal** You create a permanent gateway between the demiplane and a single other location. You must spend the ritual's casting time constructing the gateway on the external side, which typically resembles an arch or doorway of some sort. The gate is always active, but it can be secured as you would any door.\n    \n*   **Scope** The demiplane can be unbounded instead of finite, though still with the same size.\n    \n\n**Critical Success** You create a new demiplane whose area consists of two contiguous squares, each 100 feet on a side. The ceiling is 20 feet high. If modifying an existing demiplane, you can instead either add this area to the demiplane's size or add two special traits or features.\n\n**Success** As critical success, but the demiplane's area is a single square, 100 feet on a side and a ceiling 20 feet high. If modifying an existing demiplane, you can add one special trait or feature.\n\n**Failure** The ritual has no effect.\n\n**Critical Failure** Something goes horribly wrong, and all casters are teleported to an unknown but likely hostile plane.",

You might be guided by air elementals, anemoi, or even the Lords of Air themselves. You receive guidance as either words of wisdom or a rustling wind that guides you to a helpful destination—whichever the spirits think will be most beneficial. The spirits don't give guidance you can't follow, such as winds that lead somewhere you can't reach, nor do they give advice that will help their causes at the expense of your own. If you've upset all the spirits of air, they don't mislead you but do refuse to guide you.\n\n*   **Guiding Gale** (detection) A noticeable wind flows continuously toward a destination the spirits think will be valuable for you to find. Though you can't ask for a specific destination, the spirits understand your current circumstances and urgent priorities. They won't lead you to a location you're already aware of or can currently see, unless this might lead you to a fruitful destination you've already dismissed as an option. The spell has a duration of 8 hours or until you reach the destination, whichever comes first. When you arrive, the winds swirl in playful circles and then disperse to make it clear you're in the right place.\n*   **Voice of the Sky** (auditory, linguistic, prediction) A voice on the wind, clearly audible to you, gives you advice on a course of action that holds positive potential for you. This advice is rarely more than two or three sentences long, typically spoken in Sussuran if you understand it, and Common if not. If you can't hear, the spirits blow small objects around to mimic written words or sign language. If following the advice poses great danger, the spirits typically note this risk but rarely go into detail. The advice is instant, so the spell doesn't have a duration.",

You can Shield Block with the glass shield. It has Hardness 2. You can use the spell’s reaction to reduce damage from any spell or magical effect, even if it doesn’t deal physical damage.

When you [Cast this Spell](link_action_19611), choose one of the Fleshforged below to summon.\n\n*   **Bone Breaker** _Size_ Gargantuan, _Speed_ 40 feet, climb 100 feet; **Arrive** _Skull Breaking Hum_ ([sonic](link_trait_1484)) The Bone Breaker appears in a shower of bone fragments. Its form is that of an immense titan of flesh and metal with long, muscular, twisted arms. The Bone Breaker releases a hum at a harmonic frequency that weakens bones in creatures' bodies. Each foe within an 80-foot emanation must attempt a Fortitude save. On a critical success, they're unaffected; on a success, they're enfeebled 2 for 1 round; on a failure they're enfeebled 3 for 1 minute; and on a critical failure, they're enfeebled 4 for 10 minutes. A [skeleton](link_trait_3157) or other [undead](link_trait_2425) foe made almost entirely of bones treats their result as one degree of success worse than they rolled. **Depart** _Bruising Departure_ The Bone Breaker pounds its long arms into the ground, creating a long shockwave. Each foe within a 100-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line takes 8d12 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Fortitude save.\n    \n*   **Scion of Desiccation** _Size_ Gargantuan, _Speed_ 100 feet, fly 100 feet; **Arrive** ([void](link_trait_1485)) _Ashes to Ashes_ The Scion of Desiccation appears in a swirl of screaming wind, a gargantuan form of twisted flesh that's constantly flensed by gritty ash and dust, and just as constantly regenerating itself. Each foe within a 40-foot emanation takes 10d10 [void](link_trait_1485) energy damage, with a basic Fortitude save; **Depart** ([void](link_trait_1485)) _Dust to Dust_ Each foe within a 60-foot emanation must attempt a Fortitude save; they're drained 2 on a failure or drained 4 on a critical failure.\n    \n*   **The Thousand** _Size_ Medium (see below), _Speed_ 30 feet; **Arrive** ([emotion](link_trait_1486), [fear](link_trait_1487), [mental](link_trait_1448)) _Disconcerting Arrival_ Select five spaces in range and summon a Medium-sized polyp of The Thousand in each of these spaces. The Thousand is an entity whose full scope is 1,000 polyps of oozing flesh, each physically separate but mentally part of a single creature. Not all 1,000 polyps have survived, and the spell summons five of them. Each creature within 10 feet of any of the polyps must attempt a Will Save. On a critical success, they're unaffected; on a success, they're frightened 1; on a failure, they're frightened 3; and on a critical failure, they're frightened 4 and fleeing for 1 round; **Depart** ([illusion](link_trait_1447), [mental](link_trait_1448)) _Violent Omen_ Each frightened foe within a 60-foot emanation of any of the five polyps takes 10d8 [mental](link_trait_1448) damage, with a basic Will save.\n    \n*   **Thorn Caller** _Size_ Gargantuan, _Speed_ 100 feet; **Arrive** ([light](link_trait_1517)) _Thorn's Guidance_ The Thorn Caller appears in a burst of [light](link_trait_1517). The Thorn Caller's body is an ornate armored sphere with black panther masks surrounding a glowing [light](link_trait_1517). The ball floats in the air due to six glowing, thornlike wings. Two clusters of bird heads emerge from both sides of the body with long necks that twirl together like tentacles. The Thorn Caller's burst of [light](link_trait_1517) illuminates all foes within 200 feet. The foes become dazzled and off-guard, and if they were invisible, they become concealed instead. These effects last until the Thorn Caller departs. **Depart** _Thorn-Burst_ The Thorn Caller launches its thorned wings at various targets. Attempt spell attack rolls against up to 6 different targets within 300 feet. On a hit, the target takes 10d8 piercing damage, double on a critical hit, half on a failure, and none on a critical failure.",

When the [fire](link_trait_1542) is hot enough, you roast bat wings, horse hooves, and lizards over it until they're tender enough to eat; for the hooves, this could take hours. Throughout this time, you meditate and recite passages of texts holy to Lamashtu, ruminating on the beauty and necessity of the monstrous and twisting your mindset into a monstrous shape, the better to hold the evil that will come to possess you.\n\nOnce the wings, hooves, and lizards are cooked, you and your accomplices eat these items in their entirety, tearing them only with your teeth, and you must eat more than anyone else involved. You then scoop out a trench at the location where you previously lit the [fire](link_trait_1542), folding the hot rocks into the [earth](link_trait_1523). Your accomplices then bury you shallowly in the trench—you should be able to breathe but not necessarily able to see. Your accomplices then recite the correct texts and draw upon the power of transmutation while you infuse your mind further with the power and beauty of the monstrous. This stage continues for hours, until the setting of the sun. With the departure of its final ray and in accordance with your faith and occult power, you'll rise transformed.\n\n**Critical Success** You sprout enormous bat wings, a lizard-like tail, pointed teeth, hooves, and an equine head. You gain [darkvision](link_sense_20769); if you already had [darkvision](link_sense_20769), you instead gain [greater darkvision](link_sense_20770). You gain jaws and hoof [unarmed](link_trait_2398) melee [Strikes](link_action_19856), which are the only attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +23 or your [unarmed](link_trait_2398) attack modifier, whichever is higher. Your jaws [Strike](link_action_19856) deals 2d10+6 piercing damage, and your hoof [Strike](link_action_19856) deals 2d6+6 bludgeoning damage with the [agile](link_trait_1569) and [versatile S](link_trait_1837) traits. These attacks are Strength-based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). You gain a fly Speed of 40 feet. You also gain a version of the Sandpoint Devil's Accursed Breath: once per hour, you can breathe a 30-foot cone of flame that deals 10d6 [fire](link_trait_1542) damage. Your mind transforms, subsuming your own personality with that of the Sandpoint Devil. Unlike many [polymorph](link_trait_1453) spells, you can't [Dismiss](link_action_19627) this spell.\n\n**Success** As critical success, except your fly Speed is 20 feet, and you can use your breath weapon once per day.\n\n**Failure** You fail to transform yourself.\n\n**Critical Failure** Not only do you fail to transform yourself, but the ritual's secondary casters all transform into Sandpoint Devils for 1 minute, and they immediately attack you.",

While the [_teleportation circles_](link_spell_6690) and portals found in the Abomination Vaults require no additional cost to awaken, other portals might require rare items or specific materials as a cost for this ritual at the GM's discretion—some portals might even be so powerful that this ritual cannot awaken them at all.\n\nThe DC required to successfully awaken a portal varies based on the strength and distance between its end points. For the portals found in the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path, the DC varies according to the dungeon level on which it is located. Thus, activating the portal on the first level of the Abomination Vaults requires a successful DC 15 check, while activating the portal on the fourth level requires a successful DC 23 check.\n\n**Critical Success** You awaken the portal. If its other side is awakened, the portal can be used normally and won't deactivate naturally. If its other side is not awakened, this side remains awakened for 1 year, possibly allowing you enough time to find and awaken the connecting portal.  \n**Success** As critical success, but if the portal's other side is not awakened, this side remains awakened for only 1d6 days before it fades and falls dormant again.  \n**Failure** You fail to activate the portal, and magical backlash leaves you stupefied 1 for 24 hours.  \n**Critical Failure** As failure, but in addition, a hostile creature is drawn through the portal and immediately attacks anyone present. The creature drawn through the portal varies, according to the portal's nature; in the Abomination Vaults, the creature conjured depends on the dungeon level where the ritual was attempted, as listed below.\n\n**First Level** vampiric mist  \n**Second Level** scalathrax  \n**Third Level** gibbering mouther  \n**Fourth Level** will-o'-wisp  \n**Fifth Level** soul eater  \n**Sixth Level** voidglutton  \n**Seventh Level** dread wraith  \n**Eighth Level** ghost mage  \n**Ninth Level** gosreg  \n**Tenth Level** shining child",

The lore possessed by the dead will only increase as time marches on. To be alive is to define your knowledge as being limited, but with the corpse communion ritual, you can, if only for a short time and through a narrow aperture, tap into the greater lore of the dead and make use of it for your own designs.\n\nWhen you perform this grisly ritual, you consume a portion of a dead body, taking the decayed flesh and old bones into your system while also taking into your mind the memories etched into those mortal remains. The corpse from which you harvest your necromantic meal cannot have been dead for longer than 1 month, and it need not even be entirely intact, but enough should be present to form what would be regarded as a satisfying meal. If, in life, the corpse was the same ancestry as your own, then you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the primary check to cast corpse communion. Note that when you perform corpse communion, the remains you consume are largely a symbolic bridge between this material world and the world of the dead. The ritual allows you to tap into the vast amount of knowledge and secrets held by the dead as a whole, not simply knowledge that may have once been held by the creature you feed upon.\n\nWhen you perform this ritual, select a single Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill whose secrets you wish to delve into, but in which you possess no greater proficiency in than trained.\n\nThe ritual itself does not protect you from potential infection from eating decayed flesh, and at the GM's discretion, performing this ritual could expose you to a [disease](link_trait_1857), [curse](link_trait_1855), or other affliction.\n\nIf you perform corpse communion again while already under its effects, the effects of any previous success or critical success are replaced by the results of the new ritual casting.\n\n**Critical Success** You learn a significant piece of lore, a forgotten secret, or some other tantalizing nugget of knowledge that is of immediate use to you, connected to the skill you chose. The GM will provide you with some piece of information they know will aid you in your personal goals. In addition, you become trained in the use of the selected skill and gain a +1 status bonus on checks made with that skill.\n\n**Success** You become expert in the use of the selected skill.\n\n**Failure** You fail to learn anything from the communion.\n\n**Critical Failure** A malevolent spirit, be it a supernatural presence sensing an opportunity or the soul of the corpse you're feeding upon, lashes out at you as you feed, drawing from you your memories and secrets and taking them away into the realm of the dead forever. You not only become stupefied 3, but you no longer know the corpse communion ritual. You can attempt to learn it again, but the DC to learn this ritual increases by 5.",

Cliffs might collapse, causing creatures to fall, or a river might be blocked and flood the surrounding area.\n\n*   **Stone Debris** The area becomes difficult terrain.\n    \n*   **Rising Pillars** Pillars of smooth stone rise from your chosen number of 10-foot squares on a surface in the area, ascending up to 60 feet in height. Each pillar stops when it hits a structure or ceiling unless that structure collapses (see below). The DC to [Climb](link_action_19612) or [Grab an Edge](link_action_19724) on a pillar is 30. Each creature on a pillar after it rises must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or fall off the nearest edge (the creature can choose which edge, if several are equally close). A creature on a pillar that is stopped by a structure falls without attempting a save.\n    \n*   **Structural Collapse** Structures and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (DC 14 for a sturdy structure, DC 9 for an average structure and most natural formations, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). In general, shoddy structures automatically collapse. A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures beneath it; each creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to avoid it. If the creature is forced to attempt a Reflex save because it was on a rising pillar, it uses the same result.\n    \n\n**Critical Success** The creature takes half collapse damage.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half the collapse damage and falls prone.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls prone.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes the full collapse damage and is restrained by debris until it successfully [Escapes](link_action_19632) (DC equal to the spell's save DC).",

If you do, the fort remains for another 24 hours.\n\nThe fort must be created on a plot of land free of other structures. It adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural requirements for being built there. The fort adjusts around small features, such as ponds or spires of rock, but can't be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the foundation reaches solid ground. If created on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, roll a DC 3 flat check each day the fort is present; on a failure, the fort sinks or collapses sometime during that day, and the spell ends.\n\nThe fort doesn't harm creatures within the area when it appears, and it can't be created within a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the fort when the spell is cast ends up unharmed inside the complete fort and always has a clear path of escape.",

(Of course, Merlokrep has no intention of changing how he refers to the crown should he succeed at this ritual—it will always be the [_Crown of the Kobold King_](link_item_14556) to him and his subjects!)\n\nAt one point during the [casting](link_action_19611) of this ritual, an enemy of the primary caster must be sacrificed. Initially, Merlokrep intended to use the abducted victims as these sacrifices, but the blood of a PC will do just as well!\n\nIf you wish to include this ritual as something the PCs must instead use to potentially undo the _Crown of the Kobold King's_ magic, the ritual instead requires rare incense and offerings worth a total value of 60 gp instead of a blood sacrifice.\n\n**Critical Success** The rite is a complete success, and the [_Crown of the Kobold King_](link_item_14556) is bolstered to its true potential. What these powers might be are left to the GM to devise as they see fit. If this rite is being performed to neutralize the [_Crown of the Kobold King_](link_item_14556)'s potential, you instead render the [magic](link_trait_1504) item forever unsuitable for ascension to the _Crown of Toil_.\n\n**Success** The rite is a partial success, but the crown isn't yet complete. If you attempt this ritual again the next day, primary and secondary checks made to determine its success gain a +2 circumstance bonus.\n\n**Failure** The ritual fails but can be attempted again without additional penalties.\n\n**Critical Failure** The ritual fails, and the primary caster becomes stupefied 2.

Supposedly, the ritual and offerings gain Lao Shu Po’s attention, who sends her rodent children to eat and drink their fill and grant stolen blessings of moonlit sight.

These stories claim the winter goddess is often drawn to lovers, friends, or families who hold sincere affection and genuine respect for each other. _Last night’s vigil_ is a folk ritual inspired by these stories, offering a chance at respite for those who wish the goddess’s esoteric gifts not for themselves but for their loved ones.\n\nThis simple ritual can only be performed at night, in the presence of someone whom you love, and who’s ill, hurt, or otherwise unwell. You must stay awake through the night, keeping the sticks of incense lit to guide the goddess’s passage. If you’re indoors, you should keep a door or window slightly ajar to receive her holy presence.

By starting with a [consecrate](link_spell_4534) ritual and then applying Sangpotshi theories of the cyclical nature of life and reincarnation, along with insights gleaned from Zoudou’s notes, you’ve created a magical ritual that can quiet the angry spirits that haunt this misty barrier and allow other creatures to pass through into the regions beyond.\n\nThis ritual is unlikely to grant total protection from the ghosts or evil spirits within the wall itself, so once you open the wall, you and your allies might need to face additional dangers within before you can exit the other side. In addition, the ritual must be performed during a crescent or new moon (a time that equates to the second half of each month).\n\n**Critical Success** The ritual succeeds and offers unexpected protection while you’re passing through the Wall of Ghosts.

With the use of this ritual, you can temporarily transmigrate out of the mindscape to appear in the living world in a solid body made of ectoplasm, where you can exist for a short time in a hazy area between life and undeath. Before casting this ritual, the PCs must construct a kiln made of earth and stone that is large enough for all of them to lie down inside of. Once the kiln is complete, the PCs must prepare beds of clay for themselves in the kiln, surrounding each one with heron feathers placed upright in the clay around the bed. When the four-hour casting of the ritual is completed, the PCs become infused with spiritual energy and must lie down on the still-wet clay beds, after which assistants come in to encase them in a three-inch-thick layer of additional clay. Short lengths of bamboo held in the mouth allow the clay-encased PCs to continue breathing. The incense and sakaki wood is then placed atop each encased PC, the kiln is closed, and the fires lit. Each PC is baked alive within their clay shells, but if the ritual is successful, they’re sent into the living world as ectoplasmic apparitions.\n\n**Critical Success** The clay cracks open and the PCs transmigrate into the border between life and death, a small mindscape in which they face a challenge they must overcome if they’re to transmigrate into the living world. During this encounter, the PCs gain a +1 status bonus to all [Strikes](link_action_19856), saving throws, and skill checks. If they defeat the encounter, they fully transmigrate into the living world for up to 1 month, and retain a +1 status bonus to all skill checks for the first week of this month.\n\n**Success** As critical success, but without the status bonus to skill checks.\n\n**Failure** As a critical success, but extra energy is sapped from the PCs. They gain a –1 status penalty to all [Strikes](link_action_19856), saving throws, and skill checks made in the border between life and death, and if they transmigrate to the living world, they also take a –1 status penalty to all skill checks for the first week of the ritual’s monthlong duration.\n\n**Critical Failure** The ritual fails, and the PCs do not enter the border between life and death. Instead, they each take 9d6 [fire](link_trait_1542) damage as they each bake in their clay shells (DC 24 basic Fortitude save) before the failed ritual snuffs out the flames and cracks open their partially fired clay casings.

This more complex version of the ritual has a cast time of 5 days and affects the entire mindscape. Furthermore, this ritual can only be attempted after the first day of the new year in the mindscape (the 72nd day of this adventure), as it also draws upon that milestone societal event to work its magic. Any attempt to cast this version of transmigrate before either of those two requirements are fulfilled causes the casting to fail as it begins, before any checks are attempted or its costs are paid. This version of the ritual must be cast near Willowshore’s Eternal Lantern, which is located on the southern side of Dawnstep Bridge. As with the 4th-rank version of transmigrate, this ritual requires the creation of a kiln within 30 feet of the Eternal Lantern, within which a scale model of the town of Willowshore must be crafted from clay. On the first day of casting, the kiln itself is prepared and anointed with aromatic oils. On the second day, a platform of sakaki wood slats is built in the kiln and then anointed with additional oils. On the third day, the town of Willowshore is sculpted on the platform from clay. On the fourth day, heron feathers and sticks of incense are placed in the sculpture’s still drying clay; the sticks of incense are lit and continually replaced through the day as they burn. Finally, on the fifth day, the kiln is lit and the sculpture is fired. The next day, as the people of Willowshore awaken from the ritual, its effects become apparent.\n\n*   **Critical Success** The Willowshore mindscape transmigrates wholly into the living world. The full extent of what transmigrates depends on how many Preparation Points remain unspent at the end of this adventure, but the Critical Success at this ritual grants the party an additional 12 Preparation Points to determine this success, as detailed at the start of the next adventure.\n    \n*   **Success** As critical success, without bonus Preparation Points.\n    \n*   **Failure** The ritual fails, but a new attempt can be made after 24 hours have passed.\n    \n*   **Critical Failure** As failure, but the failed ritual also spreads waves of despair through town, causing food stores to rot away and buildings to take damage as if affected by years of neglect. The party loses 12 of their remaining Preparation Points, deducted as they see fit from Hope Points, Food Points, and Security Points. If the party can’t deduct the full 12 points from their remaining Preparation Points, reduce all points to 0. Their next attempt to cast the ritual at 5th-rank takes a –2 status penalty to its checks."

At the GM’s discretion, the most powerful of mindscapes, such as those created by a deity, might be immune to this ritual’s effects. Over the course of this ritual’s casting, you and the secondary casters unravel the basic and fundamental ideas of the mindscape’s anchors. As you do so, flashes of memory tied to the anchor you target flood your mind, before the anchor itself dissipates. The mindscape might react with hostility to this process, manifesting creatures or swaying primary inhabitants to stop you. Regardless of how many anchors in all must be dismantled, it always takes a day to perform this ritual.\n\n**Critical Success** The mindscape is destroyed, and you and the secondary casters are returned to the plane from which you hailed before entering the mindscape.\n\n**Success** The mindscape is destroyed, but you and the secondary casters are scattered randomly to locations on other planes.\n\n**Failure** The mindscape is not destroyed, and you and the and the secondary casters are scattered randomly to locations on other planes.\n\n**Critical Failure** The mindscape is not destroyed, and you and the secondary casters become drained 3 and are then each plunged into separate mindscapes.

The first 50 minutes of this ritual's casting are spent preparing the target creature for the reading by meditating, concentrating on the task or goal to be focused on, and allowing you to paint or ink occult symbols from the harrow onto the target's body to link them to the upcoming reading. The final 10 minutes of the ritual comprise the reading itself, during which the symbols placed on the target fade away while infusing their fate.\n\nThe target of _harrowing_ must describe a set of events or course of action they intend to attempt in the near future— something like “hunting down a specific wanted criminal” or “traveling to Varisia to investigate the Storval Stairs.” You can roleplay out the actual harrow reading if you wish, using any spread to perform the reading, but at the ritual's completion, a single potential opportunity for the target to manipulate fate bonds to their destiny, depending on the result of your primary skill check to perform this ritual.\n\nAs long as this ritual's duration persists, the creature is temporarily immune to further _harrowing_ rituals.\n\n**Critical Success** The target gains agency over fate and chance while in the pursuit of their goal, gaining a “wild card.” Randomly determine a harrow suit, either by rolling 1d6 or by drawing a card from a full harrow deck, and then consult the Associated Suit Checks table below. At any point during _harrowing's_ duration, the creature can expend this wild card to immediately reroll any associated check they just made, gaining a +4 status bonus to the reroll. They must use the second result. Once this reroll is taken and the wild card is spent, the _harrowing_ ritual's effects end.\n\n**Success** As critical success, but the wild card does not grant a status bonus to the reroll.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the wild card instead grants a –4 status penalty to the reroll.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target's destiny is beyond their capability to manipulate. The wild card has no effect, and further _harrowing_ rituals cast on the target for one month automatically result in critical failures.\n\n#### **Associated Suit Checks**\n\n| Suit | Associated Check |\n\n|---|---|\n\n| 1—Hammers (Str) | Strikes (both melee and ranged) |\n\n| 2—Keys (Dex) | Reflex saving throws |\n\n| 3—Shields (Con) | Fortitude saving throws |\n\n| 4—Books (Int) | Skill checks |\n\n| 5—Stars (Wis) | Will saving throws |\n\n| 6—Crowns (Cha) | All other checks (including flat checks) |",

When you Cast this Spell, you summon a warden depending on the biome in which the spell is cast (for instance, summoning the Warden of Caverns and Burrows if summoned in a cave, canyon, or other underground environment). In an unnatural environment, the warden summoned depends on the region's most recent or similar natural biome, as decided by the GM.\n\n*   **Warden of Caverns and Burrows** Speed 60 feet, burrow 100 feet; **Arrive**(earth) _Obsidian Cage_ Obsidian stalagmites burst from the earth as the warden surfaces, impaling enemies and trapping them in stalagmites. Enemies on the ground within 40 feet take 6d6 piercing damage (basic Reflex save). Creatures that fail their save become \\[\\[Immobilized\\]\\] until they \\[\\[Escape\\]\\] (the DC is your spell DC); **Depart**(earth) _Blessing of the Depths_ The squares occupied by the warden remain disheveled and broken, becoming difficult terrain. The warden affects you and all your allies within 60 feet with a mountain resilience and unfettered pack. The duration for both spells is reduced to 3 rounds, but the duration of mountain resilience isn't reduced when an affected target is hit by a bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing attack.\n*   **Warden of Forests and Meadows** Speed 120 feet; **Arrive**(illusion, mental) _Idyllic Panorama_ The warden's presence unpredictably warps the appearances and perceived distances of creatures and obstacles around it. Each time an enemy within 40 feet of the warden attempts a Strike or Stride action, it takes 4d6 mental damage (basic Will save). On a critical failure, the creature Strikes a random target within reach or Strides in a random direction. On a critical success, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 1 round; **Depart**_Fox's Insightful Trickery_ The warden affects you and all your allies within 60 feet with blur and truesight. The duration for both spells is reduced to 3 rounds.\n*   **Warden of Oceans and Rivers** Speed 60 feet, swim 120 feet; **Arrive** _I Am the Tide_ If the warden is summoned in a body of water, it creates a churning whirlpool that deals 10d6 bludgeoning damage to all creatures within 30 feet (basic Reflex save). A creature that fails this save is pulled 15 feet closer to the warden (30 feet on a critical failure). If the warden is summoned outside of a body of water, it creates a wave of water that deals 8d6 bludgeoning damage to all creatures within 30 feet (basic Reflex save). A creature that fails this save is pushed 10 feet away from the warden; **Depart**_Acclimation to the Deep_ The warden affects you and your allies within 60 feet with feet to fins and water breathing. The duration for both spells is reduced to 3 rounds, but a creature affected by feet to fins retains its normal land Speed.\n*   **Warden of Peaks and Skies** Speed 60 feet, fly 240 feet; **Arrive**_Precipice Plummet_ The warden appears, flying downward from the sky and sends a shockwave where she lands. Creatures within 20 feet take 10d6 sonic damage (basic Fortitude save). Creatures that critically fail their saves are \\[\\[Sickened\\]\\]{Sickened 1}; **Depart**(auditory) _Song of the Skies_ The warden affects you and all your allies within 60 feet with fly and unfettered movement. The duration for both spells is reduced to 3 rounds.",

These astral forms can be used to explore the Astral Plane indefinitely, while the targets’ bodies remain safely in stasis on the plane where the ritual was cast (where they remain unconscious and can’t be awoken normally). The casters must be in physical contact with one another in a circle for the duration of the casting, and all targets must be selected from these casters.\n\nA target’s astral form is a duplicate of the target and everything they’re carrying; anything that happens to a duplicate item happens to the original as well. For instance, if you use, spend, destroy, lose, or give away an item’s duplicate, the original vanishes from your possession. For the duration of the ritual, any of the targets can spend a single action to [Dismiss](link_action_19627) their astral form and immediately return to their physical body. As the primary caster, when you [Dismiss](link_action_19627) your astral form, you can also [Dismiss](link_action_19627) all the other targets’ astral forms as part of the same action, returning all targets to their physical forms simultaneously. While in the Astral Plane, the other targets are unable to navigate without you, and if they become separated from you, they must wait for your return or [Dismiss](link_action_19627) their own astral forms. When the ritual ends, the targets’ astral forms vanish.\n\nA target’s astral form and corresponding physical form are linked by an incorporeal silver cord, which is visible only in the Astral Plane. This nearly unbreakable cord serves as conduit and safety line; if severed, the target’s astral and physical forms are both immediately slain. If the ritual is interrupted by an external force, such as [dispel magic](link_spell_4572) being cast on a target’s physical or astral form, the target is immediately and harmlessly returned to their physical body. If a target’s astral form is slain, the silver cord immediately rips them back to their physical body; the strain requires them to attempt a Fortitude save with the same DC as the ritual’s primary check. On a failure, the creature dies; on a success, it becomes clumsy 2, drained 2, doomed 2, and enfeebled 2 for 1 week; these conditions can’t be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed. A target’s physical body remains in suspended animation for the duration of the ritual, but if it’s destroyed, the creature dies and its astral form also vanishes.\n\nThis ritual only projects a portion of the targets’ consciousnesses onto the Astral Plane. To travel physically to the Astral Plane (to reach the Outer Planes, for example) requires spells such as [interplanar teleport](link_spell_4687).\n\n**Critical Success** All targets are able to navigate independently in the Astral Plane. Each target’s silver cord is stronger than usual, providing them a +4 circumstance bonus to its Fortitude save to avoid dying if its astral form dies.\n\n**Success** You successfully project the targets.\n\n**Failure** You fail to project the targets.\n\n**Critical Failure** The process of separating the targets’ spirits from their bodies is complicated, and something goes catastrophically wrong. All casters become doomed 1, are immediately reduced to 0 Hit Points, and begin dying.",

You then use those samples to grow a duplicate of the target’s physical form that will house the target’s soul upon death.

Once the ritual is successfully completed, the duplicate grows within the laboratory equipment for 2d4 months.

When you create the facade, you determine which illusory elements remain static (limited to basic natural movement, such as flags blowing in the breeze) and which follow a basic program (for example, a daily parade in the town square, complete with marching band).

You create a singularity in a 5-foot square that is unoccupied by any creatures. All creatures and unsecured objects in the area are moved toward the singularity when the spell is [cast](link_action_19611), at the end of their turn, and whenever they use an action to move within the area, all depending on their Reflex saving throws. This follows the rules for forced movement. If there’s not enough space near the center of the singularity, creatures and objects nearer to the center move first, and others move as far as they can without being blocked, up to the amount set by their saving throw outcomes. A creature within the area of the spell reduces its Speed by half when moving away from the singularity, but can move double its Speed when moving toward it\n\nA creature or object that enters or starts their turn in the square containing the singularity takes 10d10 [void](link_trait_1485) damage. A creature in the singularity can take no actions except an Athletics check against your spell DC to [Escape](link_action_19632) the singularity. If a creature was moved into the singularity when it attempted to use a move action and [Escapes](link_action_19632) on the same turn, it can complete the movement without spending an action or attempting an additional Reflex saving throw. Multiple creatures can occupy the square containing the singularity, as they’re considered to be in an [extradimensional](link_trait_1559) space. When the spell ends, the singularity disappears, and creatures and objects that were sucked into the singularity appear in the space where you conjured it (or as close as possible to that space, if they can’t all fit within it). When the spell is [cast](link_action_19611), or when creatures move within the area, or end their turn within the area, targets must attempt a Reflex save.\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature moves 10 feet toward the center.\n\n**Failure** The creature moves 20 feet toward the center.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature moves 30 feet toward the center",

If the target is deceased, it can’t have been dead for longer than 1 week, or this spell fails; once a corpse has been subjected to _hologram memory_ by any caster, any subsequent castings of _hologram memory_ fail.\n\nIf the target is unwilling to share this memory, it can attempt a Will save to resist this spell.",

The assistant uses a bonus equal to your modifier in Occultism for its rolls to [Aid](link_action_19604), regardless of what skill it is [Aiding](link_action_19604) with. On each of your turns, the assistant prepares to [Aid](link_action_19604) its target again. You can use a free action, which has the [concentrate](link_trait_1432) trait, to redirect the assistant to a different creature, changing the target of the spell. Otherwise, the assistant keeps aiding the same creature for the duration of the spell.",

Food can form long-lasting bonds, and with a bit of extra work, those bonds can be shared. You prepare a meal for a small gathering of up to 10 close friends, enough people to comfortably eat together at one table or in one circle. As you collect and prepare the food, you call upon spirits of home and memory. As they work through you and guide you, you perfectly recreate a dish that emotionally connects you to a place of your past: perhaps your mother’s cooking when you were a child, or the way you and your comrades-in-arms cooked rations together when you fought in the war. When you’re done, you share the meal and tell your new friends the story that comes with it. As they eat and drink, any participants of 4th level or lower sink into a snapshot of your past and can borrow insights from it for future use.\n\n**Critical Success** Your friends are vividly taken through your memories as you relive them, and they hold onto the experience even after the fugue ends. For the next week, they have a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception and Diplomacy checks to convince anyone from the community where the meal originated from that they are from that area or were present for events you described. Even after the raw magic infusing the memories fade, the memories don’t, and your friends will be able to make the dish just as well as you can. Chances are, they like it just as much as you did.\n\n**Success** As critical success, except your friends get a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception and Diplomacy checks instead. They also can’t make the meal themselves but probably look forward to tasting it the way you make it if you ever offer to cook it again.\n\n**Failure** Your friends see the vision as planned, but the magic doesn’t quite take. As success, but no one receives any bonus. The real treasure will have to be the friends you fed along the way.\n\n**Critical Failure** Your friends see the vision as planned, and the magic takes hold—but it goes wrong, like a bad case of indigestion. The memories are scattered around the rest of their psyches, and it takes a week to settle down properly. They confuse parts of your past for theirs, and they take a –2 circumstance bonus to Deception and Diplomacy checks for the next week against anyone from your old community, as they confidently apply the wrong expectations from their lives across the one you were trying to introduce them to.",

And what better way to impress than a cook-off? This old ritual has roots in the spirit\u0002adjudicated village festival contests of rural Tian Xia. Two or more rival parties must participate, performing the ritual simultaneously as assistants gather and prepare ingredients while each team’s head chef does their best to create the ultimate dish to satisfy their patron’s palate. Cheering bystanders are usually involved. While the primary caster—the chef—is always busy with cooking, it’s very normal for the secondary caster assistants to spend most of their time interfering with the other teams and slowing them down.\n\n**Critical Success** You’ve truly blown your patron away with the competition and the meal you’ve expertly crafted. The supernatural patrons you sought to impress grant a request as if you’d received a critical success to [Make a Request](link_action_19844) of them, even if they’re indifferent or unfriendly to you. If there’s some argument or confusion on what request should be granted, the patrons grant the request of the team that achieved the highest overall result. At the GM’s discretion, the attitude of any patrons pleased by the ritual can permanently increase toward all participants in the ritual. In addition, the sheer theatricality and flair of your cooking has earned you deep respect and die-hard fans from the spectators, doubly so if you tied with another contender.\n\n**Success** You’ve created a wonderful meal that your patron loves. The supernatural patrons you sought to impress grant a request as if you’d received a success to [Make a Request](link_action_19844) of them, even if they’re indifferent to you. If there’s some argument or confusion on what request should be granted, the patrons grant the request of the team that achieved the highest overall result. At the GM’s discretion, the attitude of any patrons pleased by the ritual can permanently increase toward all participants in the ritual. All contestants have still earned the jovial respect and appreciation of the crowd for cooking something entertaining and lovely.\n\n**Failure** You’ve created a dish that doesn’t impress. The winner of the competition is declared in the most unsatisfying and mechanical of manners— someone has to win, but no one is happy about it. The supernatural patrons you sought to impress politely make their excuses and leave as soon as they have a chance. At the GM’s discretion, the attitude of any patrons who experienced the meal can permanently decrease toward all participants in the ritual.\n\n**Critical Failure** Your team’s dish is ruined at the last possible moment in a spectacular manner. You completely embarrass yourself, and the attitude of the supernatural patrons who experienced this farce permanently decreases by one step toward you. If you haven’t earned the ire of your patron host, you’ve definitely lost the respect of any onlookers or spectators.",

While some versions of this ritual offer all the forms, others include only a single form or only a few of them.\n\nWhichever form you use, the effect can’t be [counteracted](link_action_27519), though it can be ended by freedom. Some forms of _imprisonment_ can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.\n\n*   **Chains** You bind the creature with chains, rendering it unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 × the _imprisonment_ ritual’s spell rank and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.\n    \n*   **Prison** You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature’s prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.\n    \n*   **Slumber** You put the creature into an eternal sleep. This is a [sleep](link_trait_1650) effect. The creature ceases aging and doesn’t require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target—whether romantically, filially, or otherwise—frees it from the slumber.\n    \n*   **Temporal Stasis** You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn’t grow older and can’t be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of _imprisonment_, temporal stasis can be [counteracted](link_action_27519) by a [dispel magic](link_spell_4572) or [haste](link_spell_4654) spell.\n    \n*   **Object (9th or 10th rank)** You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a bottle, gem, jar, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn’t require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can’t use any other actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it.\n    \n*   **Oubliette (10th rank only)** You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can’t be reached by any means. You also prevent most magic from revealing the location where the _imprisonment_ occurred. Powerful magic, such as the [wish](link_spell_4955) ritual, can reveal the location of the _imprisonment_, but even such magic can’t free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-rank freedom ritual can do so.\n    \n\n**Critical Success** You imprison the target. You can either use a form of imprisonment that usually requires a spell rank 1 higher than your ritual or impose an –2 circumstance penalty to any checks for freedom rituals that would free the creature.\n\n**Success** You imprison the target.\n\n**Failure** You fail to imprison the target.\n\n**Critical Failure** You imprison yourself and the secondary casters in the same way you intended to imprison the target.",

To cast this ritual, you must be on the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, or a plane that connects to one of the two. A demiplane created with this ritual exists on the Astral or Ethereal Plane. It can have the appearance of any mundane environment or structure, such as a glorious cathedral, a forest clearing, a comfortably furnished cavern, or anything else imaginable. All demiplanes have finite, unbreachable boundaries, which might resemble stone, wood, or something more unnatural, such as a wall of mist or unceasing void.\n\nDemiplanes have environmental conditions appropriate for the Universe, though the primary caster can dictate a general climate or light level as well as whether the demiplane experiences seasons or a day-night cycle. The demiplane has no native plants or animals, but they can be introduced, and plants will grow in a demiplane’s light.\n\nWhen you first cast create demiplane, the casters are teleported to the demiplane. The demiplane has no direct access to other worlds, so interplanar teleport or similar abilities are necessary to access it. As part of casting the ritual to create a new demiplane, you create a planar key to the demiplane that serves as an interplanar teleport locus for that demiplane. Most resemble ornate keys, but some take the form of maps, compasses, or dowsing rods.\n\nIf you have the original planar key to an existing demiplane and are also on that demiplane, you can cast this ritual again. Each time, you can either expand the demiplane’s size or add one special trait or feature described below. See pages 172–173 of GM Core for more information about these planar features.\n\n*   **Bounteous** The demiplane has a functional ecosystem with plants and animals appropriate to the environment. This ecosystem doesn’t require any additional effort on your part to maintain.\n    \n*   **Elemental** The demiplane gains the air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood planar essence trait.\n    \n*   **Gravity** The demiplane gains a gravity trait of your choice.\n    \n*   **Key** You create an additional planar key that can be used to access the demiplane with interplanar teleport and improve it with create demiplane.\n    \n*   **Portal** You create a permanent gateway between the demiplane and a single other location. You must spend the ritual’s casting time constructing the gateway on the external side, which typically resembles an arch or doorway of some sort. The gate is always active, but it can be secured as you would any door.\n    \n*   **Scope** The demiplane can be unbounded instead of finite, though still with the same size.\n    \n\n**Critical Success** You create a new demiplane whose area consists of 10 contiguous squares, each 100 feet on a side. The ceiling is 40 feet high. If modifying an existing demiplane, you can instead either add this area to the demiplane’s size or add two special traits or features.\n\n**Success** As critical success, but the demiplane’s area is two squares, each 100 feet on a side, with a ceiling 20 feet high. If modifying an existing demiplane, you can add one special trait or feature.\n\n**Failure** The ritual has no effect.\n\n**Critical Failure** Something goes horribly wrong, and all casters are teleported to an unknown but hostile plane.",

The intended lesson is that Dyzad will overcome any barrier to protect the people of Sarkoris.

While the replica persists, a target can use the [Shield Block](link_feat_20534) reaction with the replica. The replica has Hardness 15 (or Hardness 20 against fire damage). They can use this reaction to reduce damage from any spell or [magical](link_trait_1504) effect, even if it doesn’t deal physical damage. After a target uses [Shield Block](link_feat_20534), the replica dissipates. The spell ends when you no longer [Sustain](link_action_19858) it or if all three replicas have dissipated, whichever happens first.",

Once each turn, the target can spend 1 action to attempt a Computers or Perception check against your spell DC to escape the game. Teleportation magic doesn’t help the creature escape unless the magic can transport someone into or out of a virtual space. When the spell ends, either because the target escaped or the duration ran out, the target returns to the space it occupied when it was digitized, or to the nearest space if the original is now filled. The GM might decide that other genres of games allow for different skill checks but should only do so if the target has proficiency in the listed skill.\n    \n\n**Critical Success** The target completes the game and the spell ends.\n\n**Success** The target makes progress toward completing the game. If the target already made progress, it completes the game and the spell ends.\n\n**Failure** The target makes no progress toward completing the game.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target loses the game and has to start over. It loses all progress it made.",

The _holographic memory_ can be no longer than 5 minutes; if the extracted memory is longer than this, the hologram simply ends at that point. The hologram includes audio as well as visual components, but it doesn’t contain haptic, olfactory, or other components. The hologram typically plays a memory that takes place in a single scene, though it can cut to multiple scenes if they’re accurate to the memory and its length allows. The hologram plays the memory exactly as the target experienced it and from the target’s perspective, so it often lacks context.\n\nThis spell can target any living, unconscious, or deceased sentient creature with an Intelligence modifier of –3 or higher. If the target is deceased, it can’t have been dead for longer than 1 week, or this spell fails; once a corpse has been subjected to _holographic memory_ by any caster, any subsequent castings of _holographic memory_ fail.\n\nIf the target is unwilling to share this memory, it can attempt a Will save to resist this spell.",

As part of performing this ritual, you set a trigger for when the target object activates. The object remains enchanted for 1 week or until it’s activated, whichever comes first.\n\nFor 10 minutes after the object is activated, [magic](link_trait_1504) is suppressed within an emanation centered on the object. Spells can’t penetrate the area, [magic](link_trait_1504) items cease to function within it, and no one inside can cast spells or use magic abilities. Likewise, spells—such as [dispel magic](link_spell_4572)—can’t affect the emanation unless they’re of a higher rank than the ritual. Magic effects resume the moment they pass outside the emanation. For example, a caster outside of the emanation could target a [fireball](link_spell_4623) on a spot on the other side of the emanation, even if the line of effect passes through the emanation. A summoned creature winks out of existence if it enters the emanation but reappears if the emanation ends. [Invested](link_trait_1527) [magic](link_trait_1504) items cease to function, but they remain invested and resume functioning when they exit the emanation; the attribute boost from an [apex](link_trait_1552) item isn’t suppressed within the field. Spells of a higher rank than _antimagic artifice_ overcome its effects and can even be cast by a creature within the field.\n\nThe emanation disrupts only magic, so a [+3](link_item_7952) [longsword](link_item_7090) still functions as a [longsword](link_item_7090). Magically created creatures (such as [constructs](link_trait_2410) with the [magical](link_trait_1504) trait) function normally within the emanation.\n\n**Critical Success** When triggered, the antimagic emanation has a radius of 100 feet. The ritual casters are unaffected by the emanation.\n\n**Success** When triggered, the antimagic emanation has a radius of 50 feet.\n\n**Failure** The ritual has no effect.\n\n**Critical Failure** The magic of the ritual backfires, scrambling the casters’ minds. Each caster is stupefied 4. The value of this condition is reduced by 1 for each day that passes, and it can’t be removed or reduced by any other means.",

Large fortifications, such as city walls, and inhospitable natural features, such as wide rivers, will stop the trees, but the forest can shape itself around small buildings and streams.

You reach out to the pests and nuisances around you, forming a small squadron of them to harass and occupy your opponents. They swarm from the forests, the air, and even the dirt beneath your feet. The pest squadron occupies the space of a Large creature, and like a swarm, they can occupy the same space as other creatures. When you [Cast this Spell](link_action_19611), choose one of the pest squadrons below to summon.\n\n*   **Cockroaches** Speed 30 feet, climb 30 feet; **Arrive** _Scurrying Swarm_ The swarm of cockroaches scuttles toward the enemy, swarming them and climbing up the bodies of any enemy touching the ground. They deal 4d6 piercing damage (basic Reflex save) to all enemies within their space and in a 5-foot emanation. On a critical failure, a creature can't use concentrate actions for 1 round as they try and brush away the insects; **Depart** _Farewell Dirt_ The cockroaches disperse, climbing down from the creatures and leaving behind their debris and dirt. All enemies in their space must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, a creature is sickened 2 (sickened 3 on a critical failure).\n    \n*   **Mosquitoes** Speed 30 feet, fly 50 feet; **Arrive** _Biting Flight_ The mosquitoes arrive in a hazy cloud, landing on the exposed skin of your opponents and dealing 4d6 piercing damage to enemies in their space (basic Reflex save); **Depart** _Parting Gift_ The swarm attempts to drain their opponents before flying off. All enemies in their space and in a 5-foot emanation must succeed at a Fortitude save or become drained 1 (drained 2 on a critical failure).\n    \n*   **Pigeons** Speed 20 feet, fly 40 feet; **Arrive** _Dive Bomb_ The swarm of pigeons dives into the crowd of enemies and attacks with beaks and talons. Each enemy within their space takes 2d8 piercing and 2d4 slashing damage (basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, a creature is dazzled for 1 round; **Depart** ([sonic](link_trait_1484)) _Wing Snap_ The pigeon swarm snaps their wingtips together to startle their opponents before leaving. Each enemy within their space takes 4d6 [sonic](link_trait_1484) damage (basic Fortitude save).\n    \n*   **Rats** Speed 30 feet, burrow 20 feet; **Arrive** _Chittering Race_ Rats swarm the legs of your enemies, biting at them and digging their sharp nails into whatever exposed flesh reveals itself. Each enemy in their space takes 4d6 piercing damage (basic Reflex save); **Depart** _Underfoot_ The rats scurry underfoot, tripping up enemies and burrowing underground to make a swift getaway. Each enemy in their space must succeed a Reflex save or be knocked prone and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The area the rat swarm was in becomes difficult terrain for 1 round.\n    \n*   **Skunks** Speed 30 feet, climb 20 feet; **Arrive** _Mustelid Charge_ Skunks race to the scene, and each enemy within their space and within a 5-foot emanation take 4d6 piercing damage (basic Reflex save) as the skunks snarl and bite; **Depart** ([acid](link_trait_1528)) _Stink Bomb_ Before leaving, the skunks launch a final offensive maneuver and release their stink glands in a 15-foot cone. All creatures in the area take 2d6 [acid](link_trait_1528) damage (basic Fortitude save). On a failure, a creature is also sickened 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure).\n    \n*   **Spiders** Speed 30 feet, climb 30 feet; **Arrive** ([poison](link_trait_1476)) _Venomous Swarm_ horde of violin spiders crawls up from the ground, climbing onto enemies within their space and in a 5-foot emanation and biting them. Each enemy takes 3d6 piercing damage (basic Fortitude save). Enemies who fail are exposed to violin spider venom; **Depart** _Spinning Webs_ As the violin spiders depart, they spray sticky webs at their enemies in a 30-foot cone. All creatures in this cone must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, a creature takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds (–20-foot circumstance penalty on a critical failure) for 1 minute; a creature can remove this penalty with a successful [Escape](link_action_19632) against your spell DC.
