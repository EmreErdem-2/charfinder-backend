        "description": "> _Elves are a tall, long-lived people with a strong tradition of art and magic._\n\nAs an ancient people, elves have seen great change and have the perspective that can come only from watching the arc of history. After leaving Golarion in ancient times, they returned to a changed land, and they still struggle to reclaim their ancestral homes. Elves value kindness, intellect, and beauty, with many elves striving to improve their manners, appearance, and culture. Their studies delve into a level of detail that most shorter-lived peoples find excessive or inefficient. Elves are often rather private people, steeped in the secrets of their groves and kinship groups. They're slow to build friendships outside their kinsfolk, as elves who spend their lives among shorter-lived peoples often become morose after watching generations of companions age and die. These elves are known as Forlorn among their fellow elves.\n\nIf you want a character who is [magical](link_trait_1504), mystical, and mysterious, you should play an elf.",

While it's unclear why the first gnomes wandered to Golarion, this lineage manifests in modern gnomes as bizarre reasoning, eccentricity, obsessive tendencies, and what some see as naivete.\n\nAlways hungry for new experiences, gnomes constantly wander both mentally and physically, attempting to stave off a terrible ailment that threatens all of their people. This affliction, known as the Bleaching, strikes gnomes who fail to dream, innovate, and take in new experiences. The Bleaching slowly drains the color— literally—from gnomes, and it plunges those affected into states of deep depression that eventually claim their lives. Very few gnomes survive this scourge, becoming deeply morose and wise survivors known as bleachlings.\n\nIf you want a character with boundless enthusiasm and an alien, fey outlook on morality and life, you should play a gnome.",

Orcs often struggle to gain acceptance among other communities, who frequently see them as brutes. Those who earn the loyalty of an orc friend, however, soon learn that an orc's fidelity and honesty are unparalleled. Orc culture teaches that they are shaped by the challenges they survive, and the most worthy survive the most hardships. Orcs who attain both a long life and great triumphs command immense respect.\n\nIf you want a character who is hardy, fearsome, and excels at feats of physical prowess, you should play an orc.",

Optimistic, cheerful, and driven by powerful wanderlust, halflings make up for their short stature with an abundance of bravado. At once excitable and easygoing, halflings are the best kind of opportunists, and their passions favor joy over violence. While their curiosity sometimes drives them toward adventure, halflings also carry strong ties to house and home.\n\nIf you want to play a character who must contend with these opposing drives toward adventure and comfort, you should play a halfling.",

Catfolk view themselves as chosen guardians of natural places in the world and are often recklessly brave, even in the face of overwhelming opposition._\n\nCatfolk are outgoing, active [humanoids](link_trait_2399) who delight in discovery, whether of hidden ruins or a comfortable place to nap. They are exceptionally social, both within their tight-knit communities and with other creatures they meet. Remarkably brave, catfolk see themselves as guardians of the world against forces that would assail it, and they believe that strong communities, breadth of experience, and continual self-improvement aid them in this fight.\n\nCatfolk have fast reflexes and are even able to twist themselves in the air while falling to land on their feet. As quick as these reflexes are, catfolk have quicker tempers, shifting from effusive glee to aggrieved fury in an instant. Like mundane felines, catfolk involuntarily purr when pleased and growl when surprised or angry.\n\nIf you want a character who is curious, brave, friendly, and nimble in body and mind, you should play a catfolk.",

If they can’t find homes in town, ysoki may instead live in caves and cavern complexes, as these provide great storage for the many and varied goods they bring back from trading expeditions.\n\nRatfolk love to travel, and they can often be found on the road in merchant caravans. They’re good with their hands and have a keen eye for spotting anything out of the ordinary, from threats to treasures. They’re also inveterate hoarders; ysoki warrens are crammed full of unusual odds and ends gathered by previous generations and stowed away in preparation for some future emergency.\n\nIf you want a character who is smart, fast, well-traveled, and adaptable, try playing a ysoki!",

They accumulate knowledge, tools, and companions, adding them to their collection as they travel.\n\nThe tengu diaspora has spread across Golarion in search of a better life, bringing their skill with blade crafting to lands far from their home. In maritime regions, tengus notably work as fishers, blacksmiths, and “jinx eaters”— members of ships’ crews who are believed, accurately or otherwise, to absorb misfortune. Having lived in a variety of conditions and locations, tengus tend to be nonjudgmental, especially with regard to social station, though their willingness to associate with lawbreakers has often led some to look at them with suspicion.\n\nIf you want to play a character hailing from a rich history of artisanship and tradition, but who happily picks up new practices, companions, words, and items as needed, you should play a tengu.",

        "description": "> _These intelligent constructs house actual souls and represent what remains of a dying empire's last attempt at greatness. Automatons combine technological ingenuity with magical power, creating a blended being wholly unique to Golarion._\n\nThe Jistka Imperium was the first major [human](link_trait_1436) civilization to emerge after Earthfall, arising around the area that would later become Rahadoum and enduring for seven centuries thanks to great advancements in civics and the sciences. However, Jistka's leaders often favored aggressive uses of technology, and early advances paved the way for arrogance, petty infighting, and corruption. The Jistka Imperium's expansionist tendencies and lack of diplomacy earned the Imperium many enemies over the course of its existence. The most notable of these foes was the empire of Ancient Osirion. Osirion's enmity ultimately sealed the Imperium's fate, as they employed clever and depraved magic that proved more than a match for Jistka's legendary golem army, even when the Jistkans began to cut corners and bind [fiends](link_trait_2415) into their golems. In a desperate attempt to fight back against internal corruption and external pressures, a cabal of concerned Jistkans formed the Artificer Conclave to develop new technologies to stave off the Imperium's collapse and return Jistka to its former glory. The most successful of these developments were automatons, which the Conclave believed to be the pinnacle of Jistkan [constructs](link_trait_2410)—or at least, the last hope for Jistka's salvation. Conclave creators transplanted the mind, life force, and soul of Jistkan individuals into these constructs, creating [magical](link_trait_1504) and technological marvels powered by the life energy of the greatest warriors and scholars the organization could recruit. Unfortunately, despite the Conclave's best efforts, the automatons' arrival happened too late to save the already doomed Imperium. The empire collapsed, leaving automatons to fend for themselves.\n\nThe exceptional and forward-thinking construction of automatons means that a fair number remain today, millennia later, scattered to the winds. However, the passage of time has revealed one of automatons' greatest weaknesses: their mortal psyches. Only the strongest willed have managed to retain their memories, sense of self, and lucidity after all this time. As each automaton remains as unique as any living person on Golarion; a given automaton has their own personality, shaped by countless experiences. Most automatons behave reclusively, preferring to avoid others due to fear of attachment or misunderstanding. Even automatons who are more willing to live in the open understand that their unique nature makes them a prime target for hunters, scholars, or worse. Rare is the automaton that lives without the regular occurrence of distrust or worry.\n\nIf you want to play a character who is a living construct with powerful potential and ties to ancient magic, you should play an automaton.",

        "description": "> _Fleshwarps are people whose forms were created or radically transformed by magic, alchemy, or unnatural energies. Their unorthodox appearance can make it difficult for them to find a place for themselves in the world._\n\nMagic and science that can warp bone and twist sinew are all too common on Golarion. Fleshwarps are those who have been permanently altered by such methods—sometimes a sapient being created whole cloth from inanimate flesh, but often a victim unwillingly transformed by strange energies or sadistic creators.\n\nThe ancestry name “fleshwarp” is an umbrella term, since on Golarion the actual fleshwarping process is more infamously well-known than are alterations caused by uncontrolled magic, technology, or fringe science. Whether practiced by Thassilonian wizards, Nexian fleshcrafters, or the drow of the Darklands, fleshwarping is the craft of reshaping flesh and mind in vats of foul [magical](link_trait_1504) reagents. This has led some scholars of monsters to argue that only those beings created by traditional fleshwarping should be considered fleshwarps. Regardless of the source of their altered forms, fleshwarps bear their new shape forever, transformed beings living a wild and strange existence beyond what was possible for their original ancestry.\n\nAlthough fleshwarps are [humanoid](link_trait_2399), no two look the same. One might possess limbs in unusual places and skin as smooth as glass, while another might have a thick matting of spiny fur. Some might have animalistic features, like a boar snout, scales, or cloven hooves. Others have entirely alien appearances, such as bulging eyes on the backs of their hands. Some may have only subtly uncanny features that differentiate them, such as glowing teeth, smoking eyes, or fingernails made of bone. The only commonality among fleshwarps is their mismatched nature. Let your imagination run wild when creating a fleshwarp character!\n\nIf you want a character who is tough and hardy, can change their form as they grow, and can use their wholly unique appearance to inspire awe or fear in others, you should play a fleshwarp.",

These lithe and shadowy beings seem to sink and vanish into the gloom. They see in darkness, exercise control over [shadows](link_trait_1901), and have strange [occult](link_trait_1514) powers. Some fetchlings develop their powers enough to pass between the Shadow and Material Planes, leaving other ancestries to whisper about figures that emerge from shaded corners and then vanish without a trace. Through magic and other means, they've spread across Golarion and the planes beyond, as adaptable as the humans they once were.\n\nThe first fetchlings were refugees. Ages ago, when Earthfall destroyed ancient Azlant and cast the world into darkness, one small group of Azlanti pleaded for rescue. A mysterious hooded figure known as the Widow answered their call, slicing open a passage into the Shadow Plane. The Azlanti stepped through, trading the darkness of Earthfall for a deep shadow. As they navigated the plane's strange environs and dangerous inhabitants, its nature slowly worked monumental changes on the survivors.\n\nIf you want a character more at home in a mirror world of shadow, infused with umbral gloom, and who embodies the dualities of [light](link_trait_1517) and [darkness](link_trait_1900), you should play a fetchling.",

Whether they pass unseen among other peoples or hold their tails high, kitsune are clever observers of the societies around them._\n\nKitsune are shapeshifters with two forms: one of a fox-headed [humanoid](link_trait_2399) and one largely depending on where they were raised. Those raised in populated areas typically have what's called a tailless form—a humanoid body without any fox features that resembles a more common ancestry, such as an [elf](link_trait_1348) or a [human](link_trait_1436). In wooded or rural areas, their second form is more likely to be that of a fox. Though all-kitsune settlements exist, most live among people of other ancestries, granting them a degree of external insight into social rules or dynamics that others process only subconsciously. Kitsune enjoy subverting expectations as much as they do going along with them. Their fondness for jokes, stories, and wordplay, especially when the twist of a riddle hinges on the listener's assumptions, reinforces their reputation as tricksters.\n\nWith dual forms and a connection to both the material and spiritual worlds, kitsune have diverse concepts of self and identity. Some even view their forms as separate individuals altogether, using them to explore different aspects of their personality.\n\nIf you want to play a character with innate [magical](link_trait_1504) talents and countless hidden facets, each revealed with a glint of the eye and a twisting grin, you should play a kitsune.",

Their dual nature makes them quick-thinking and calm under pressure, but comfortable in stillness and solitude._\n\nAndroids first arrived on Golarion during the Rain of Stars, when an interstellar vessel from the far-off planet of Androffa crash-landed, scattering debris across Numeria. While some android survivors of this crash still walk Golarion today, most were created from the technological pods, known as foundries, that operate sporadically amid the starship’s wreckage. Androids birthed from these mechanical wombs possess mature bodies and newborn souls, both organic and synthetic; they emerge knowing only their creators’ language and the motor skills necessary for survival. They have no understanding of their surroundings, origin, or purpose. Most learn how to behave through keen observation while wandering Numeria.\n\nAndroids tend to be logical introverts, rational and contemplative. Insatiably curious, with an urge to understand themselves and the world around them, androids place great value on intellectual pursuits. They have difficulty interpreting and expressing emotions, both in themselves and in others, which makes them seem distant and uncaring. While androids can forge emotional bonds, they find it more difficult to connect with non-androids.\n\nIf you want a character that’s a synthetic foreigner in a fantastic world, forced to learn the nuances of reality and society through the powers of observation and logic alone, you should play an android.",

        "description": "> _Sprites are diminutive, whimsical, and exuberant creatures from the fey realm known as the First World. They love playing pranks, exploring new things, and embracing everything to do with magic._\n\nWhen most people picture a [fey](link_trait_2021), chances are they’re thinking of a sprite. The majority of sprites remain in the First World, where they are essentially immortal, reincarnating to a new form of fey when their life eventually comes to an end. Some even meld together with others to form a more substantial body or split apart into multiple smaller fey. However, sprites are incredibly curious about all forms of magic, leading a significant number to risk the mortal world to explore the new possibilities offered by the unusually static nature of mortal existence. These creatures mix in with other, smaller groups of Material Plane comrades, including exiles from the First World, those whose family swore pacts to mortals, and even contemplative individuals curious to enter the mortal cycle of souls.\n\nThe first generation of Material Plane sprites were content to guard [magical](link_trait_1504) locations or objects, learn music, and play pranks on the unsuspecting. Panic struck when children born in the mortal world didn’t form wings upon adulthood—some sprites transitioning to the mortal world likewise lost their wings after a time. Believing this to be a sign that the mortal world was too alien for them to live there, many of the initial sprite explorers returned to the safety of the First World.\n\nHowever, their wingless children exhibited a potential unmatched by any of their ancestors, as well as a particular magical affinity for the mortal world. They became the mightiest of sprite heroes, but also, on occasion, the most dangerous villains. As they came close to reaching their full strength, many of them did grow their wings at long last: larger, unique, and more vibrant than any from the First World had seen before, a sign of their limitless potential.\n\nIf you want a character who is tiny, mercurial, and curious, you should play a sprite.",

The Ironfang Legion that stormed through Molthune and Nirmathas only a few years ago made a calculated decision to cease fighting, claim Oprak as a new homeland, and seek peace with its neighbors. Now under strict orders to not start conflicts with other nations, the hobgoblins of Oprak have begun to cautiously investigate Avistan in the spirit of cooperation rather than conquest. Many people, especially those that suffered terrible cruelties under the Ironfang Legion, fear that this is simply a pause in aggression while Oprak gains enough strength to crush its rivals. Others hope these bold soldiers might prove to be allies against the endless hordes of the Whispering Tyrant.",

Feeling like they don't fully belong with their human brethren nor with the sea that binds them, many azarketis struggle for a sense of identity and purpose.

        "description": "> _Poppets are small, basic constructs that typically help their owners with simple tasks. Occasionally, poppets gain sapience, independence, and a spark of life. Elevated beyond mere helpers or playthings, these poppets are free to chart their own destinies._\n\nMost commonly made of cloth, wicker, and wood, poppets are among the simplest of [constructs](link_trait_2410). They serve as helpers to fetch tools, clean dishes, tidy rooms, or perform other light tasks. Their size and appearance vary, but nearly all poppets appear [humanoid](link_trait_2399) in shape and between 1 to 3 feet tall. They're usually roughly made with button eyes sewn onto blank faces, strings of yarn in place of hair, and a simple dress or tunic made from coarse, cheap cloth. Wealthy families sometimes purchase poppets as toys, with their squishy bodies and stitched smiles, to keep their children company. Most poppets can't speak and lack the intellect to understand speech beyond preprogrammed orders.\n\nVery, very rarely, a common poppet spontaneously manifests a spark of life—a tiny bit of life essence— and becomes a thinking, independent creature. These events are exceedingly rare; fewer than one in a thousand gain this spark. A poppet might manifest this life essence through a magical fluke in its construction, a brush with ephemeral [spirits](link_trait_1556), or even the fervent wish of a loving child. Whatever their origin, the poppets described here as an ancestry have their own life and free will. They might consider their creators or former owners to be friends, but they acknowledge no one as their master and often leave comfortable homes or workshops to seek their place in the world.\n\nSapient living poppets usually refer to themselves as “awakened” to indicate the moment they gained clear and true self-awareness. Poppets might talk about this event as the time they “popped up,” “woke up,” or “sparked alive.” Most poppets celebrate two special anniversaries each year: the day of their initial creation (which, for most poppets, they must learn secondhand or by studying their creator's records) and the day they awoke to true consciousness.",

Largely misunderstood due to old tales of their toxicity and natural finesse, vishkanyas work to grow into more than just what stories paint them to be._\n\nThe true nature of vishkanyas' origin is a matter of debate. Some vishkanyas believe they are rejected spawn of Ravithra, which explains the animosity between vishkanyas and nagas. Others believe themselves the stolen offspring of a forgotten progenitor whose name was excised from history. Regardless, one thing is quite clear: vishkanyas are survivors. Throughout history, fear of their deadly abilities forced vishkanyas to experience subjugation, exploitation, and ostracizing. Yet through it all, they endured. Now free of chains to bind them, vishkanyas live in close-knit groups, and use their love of storytelling and the arts to keep a detailed history of their people while they determine how best to proceed in a world ripe with opportunity.",

They hold a deep reverence for holy areas and spiritual truths, an aspect many others find as intimidating as a nagaji’s appearance._\n\nNagaji are creations of the goddess Nalinivati, who was inspired by both [humans](link_trait_1436) and nagas. This inspiration, alongside nagaji's devotion to nagas, has led many to claim nagaji were created to be servants. However, Nalinivati created nagaji simply for the sake of creating. She envisioned a world where nagas and nagaji worked together to succeed, with nagas serving as sacred guardians, and nagaji living as mortals upon Golarion, respecting nagas for their strength and wisdom. Nagaji live up to this expectation, forming nations, temples, and villages with as many varied governments, societies, and traditions as there are scales on a serpent's back. If nagaji can be said to share any trait, it's devotion, be it to a community, a temple, a concept, or a lifestyle. Most nagaji are also drawn to the spiritual in all its expressions, even the darker aspects of philosophies and religions.\n\nIf you want a character who combines the crushing strength and the sinuous mystery of a serpent, you should play a nagaji.",

        "description": "> _These intelligent plant people, created by a long-dead druid, possess a sort of immortality through their seeds—unless these are destroyed by external events other than merely the ravages of time._\n\nDuring the height of the wars between Geb and Nex long ago, the archmage Nex asked the renegade druid Ghorus to create a [plant](link_trait_2913) that would feed his people even in the most inhospitable land. Ghorus did so, developing a flower that would adapt to every environment and withstand every sort of magecraft and spellworking. He succeeded too well. In the strange soil of the Impossible Lands, the flower grew and soon began to think—and then to walk and speak. These were the first ghorans. Despite their new awareness, ghorans found that many other peoples were adept at ignoring inconvenient truths, especially those involving where their next meal might come from. Bit by bit, seed by seed, ghorans grew themselves into [humanoid](link_trait_2399) forms, hoping to engender sympathy by mirroring the appearance of humanoids. It eventually worked, and the ghorans won citizenship and protected status in the nation of Nex. Even so, time and predation has taken its toll; the population of ghorans is small and ever dwindling.\n\nEach ghoran is essentially an ancient spark of life that inhabits, successively, a series of plantlike bodies. Every twenty years or so, a ghoran produces a seed. Their old body withers away as their soul enters the seed, which then swiftly produces a new body. The process brings with it minor changes in personality and some loss of more distant memories, such that each new ghoran is related to their predecessor while still being a different individual. The art of creating more ghorans died with the druid Ghorus, so they're a tiny but stable minority in the Impossible Lands, dwindling bit by bit over the centuries as a few of them fall to violence and mischance.\n\nIf you want a character who's an ancient and alien soul, trying to survive and thrive in a strange and hostile world, you should play a ghoran.",

Their inherent psychic abilities make them natural empaths but also occasionally burden them with the unceasing thoughts of their neighbors._\n\nKashrishi occupy a unique evolutionary branch native to the lands bordering the northern stretches of the Obari Ocean. Resembling [halfling](link_trait_1474)\\-sized bipedal rhinoceroses with the occasional odd insectile feature, kashrishi adapt to their environs with unusual efficiency, using a combination of rapid physical evolutions and inherent psychic powers. Kashrishi are often mistakenly referred to as having hive minds, though they're actually natural empaths, capable of discerning a creature's emotional state and impulses through proximity. This near-oracular behavior occasionally leads to misunderstandings with [humanoids](link_trait_2399) who think a kashrishi is reading their thoughts or otherwise magically influencing the conversation, though peoples more familiar with kashrishi come to value their unique insights and intuitive diplomacy.\n\nKashrishi have an atypical level of control over their physical forms, thanks to their psychic powers, and can evolve new features over the course of a single generation. Typically, these features are intentionally cultivated to help deal with a particular environmental obstacle, such as a change in weather patterns, or if an invasive species affects available food supplies near their settlements.\n\nKashrishi often tailor their evolutions to match the most successful creatures in their environment. Whether a testament to the resilience of insects or simply a quirk of their environment, many kashrishi evolutions are directly inspired by creatures like the rhinoceros beetle or giant water bug.\n\nIf you want a character that's visually distinct, able to naturally access the [occult](link_trait_1514) powers of the mind, and great at quickly making friends wherever they go, you should play a kashrishi.",

Their frightening visage and efficient tactics have given them an ill-starred reputation._\n\nIn lands to the east, such as Katapesh, kholo have earned themselves well-deserved reputations as brutal slavers and demon-worshippers. Even in the Mwangi Expanse, many outsiders believe that kholo are witches, cannibals, and worse. The truth is more complex.\n\nMwangi kholo are eminently practical and pragmatic hunters and raiders. To kholo, honor is just another word for pointless risk. Any loss of a kholo affects not just the individual, but their packmates and kin as well. Wasting time on anything but victory, whether it's mercy or cruelty, is seen as little shy of immoral. Kholo see effectiveness as a cardinal virtue and believe that the best fight is one that never gives the opponent a chance to strike back. Mwangi kholo are masters of ambushes, tactical feints, and psychological warfare—none of which endears them to their neighbors.\n\nEqually misunderstood is the kholo practice of ancestor worship and endocannibalism. Kholo consume their dead as a sign of reverence, holding a grand feast and transforming the bones of the fallen into art or weapons. Kholo extend this honor to respected foes, hoping to bring their enemy's cunning or strength into the clan. While it's a sign of admiration, not everyone sees it that way.",

Though they act in many ways like natural-born shapeshifters, their twin forms actually stem from carefully developed magic._\n\nAs a communal and peaceful people, anadi ancestors endeavored to establish trade with the neighbors of their homeland. However, these anadi soon learned that most others found their appearance to be extremely objectionable. Wishing to avoid conflict, ancient anadi retreated into isolation until they could find a solution. The answer came when their greatest scholars innovated a fusion of transmutation and illusion magic that allowed them to assume a [humanoid](link_trait_2399) form. The technique was developed, perfected, and eventually taught to the overwhelming majority of anadi.\n\nEarly efforts with their new approach to diplomacy have yielded much better results, though sporadic contact means that some outsiders whisper false legends about anadi, such as claims that they are humans who transform into monstrous spiders at moonrise. Even contemporary explorers have reported anadi as human-spider hybrids. The anadi people of the current day strive to slowly but surely create a world where they no longer need to hide their true nature.",

Some historians think them a failed experiment of a wizardly cabal—possibly a splinter of artificers from the ancient Jitska Imperium—who desperately hoped to bind a pleroma to bolster their army but who accidentally conjured shattered scraps of the [aeon](link_trait_2407) instead. Others believe conrasus were built by their ancestors using an accelerated, iterative evolution process as natural as one designed by those who build portions of their own bodies could ever hope to achieve. Most likely, it is a mix of the two.",

They have a tight-knit society, wary of outsiders, though they don't outright attack visitors.\n\nTheir history is passed down verbally and musically, and they rarely maintain written records in order to keep their knowledge safe. Often the only proof that shisks exist comes from explorers finding signs of their architecture: organic and low-impact adobe buildings carved out of mountains rather than built atop them.",

        "description": "> _Skeletons are considered among the lowest types of undead. They're typically mindless creatures, lacking many of the abilities that make other undead a serious threat. However, the animated bones of dragons, giants, and other great beasts make for dangerous foes. Powerful living creatures can retain some of their might and intellect upon returning as a skeleton. Some necromancers turn their strongest enemies into skeletal undead servants, assuming they can keep control of them._\n\nSkeleton adventurers were usually skilled and powerful in their former lives. Through unremitting force of will or extraordinary circumstances, their ego and ideals persist even in death. However, the very act of rising as a skeletal [undead](link_trait_2425) is traumatic. Memories of one's former life are usually fractured or hazy, if anything can be remembered at all. For some, these memories return with time; for others, they're gone forever. For the most part, this comes down to how the skeleton views themselves: either as a continuation of the person they once were, or an entirely new being.\n\nSkeleton adventurers often set themselves apart from other skeletons by dressing as flamboyantly as their station allows. Large, feathered caps, ornate armor, embroidered silks, or glittering jewelry are likely staples of their wardrobe. Some carve intricate “tattoos” into their bones or paint their skulls to maintain a sense of self that simple skeletons lack, and to signal to the living they're not like other undead.\n\nSkeleton adventurers must come to terms with their new identity. They aren't bound by the limitations of the living and are often underestimated.",

Merfolk use magic as other peoples might use common tools, especially to control water, create omens, and in their beguiling songs._\n\nMerfolk live in every ocean of Golarion, infinite in their variety and awe-inspiring in their majesty. They consider themselves, not without some merit, the rulers of the sea. Among the tropical reefs of the Fever Sea, merfolk build temples and palaces of brightly colored corals. Beneath the ice floes of the Shining Sea, merfolk hunt seals and whales for food in small, standoffish clans. In the Embaral Ocean, merfolk populate the great trading city of Alohmab, built into the shell of a titanic snail that crawls across the ocean floor.\n\nThough merfolk’s everyday lives aren’t all that different from those of the surface dwellers above, they have a much more intimate relationship with magic. In the [aquatic](link_trait_2429) environment of the open ocean, much that relies on [fire](link_trait_1542) and [metal](link_trait_2132) is impossible. Instead, merfolk shape sound and [water](link_trait_1584) with magic, using them as both tools and weapons. Such skills are widely distributed throughout all merfolk communities, even among those without formal [magical](link_trait_1504) training.\n\nIf you want to play a character who embodies the grace, wonder, and danger of the sea, you should play a merfolk.",

In small settlements, they engage in the subsistence farming of seaweed, train eels to serve as mounts, and create elaborate works of coral art. Their interactions with other [aquatic](link_trait_2429) ancestries are strained, as athamarus have suffered mistreatment at their hands. However, they remain curious about potential connections and what new opportunities may offer.\n\nAthamarus define themselves by their connections to the world around them. They live in communal settings among coral reefs and aquatic companion creatures that encourage large families and friend groups. Athamaru settlements established near river or sea trade routes usually maintain strong relationships with the sailors who regularly pass by, exchanging coral jewelry or information about nearby sea routes for surface goods, especially root foods like tubers, yams, and other vegetables, which they see as delicacies.\n\nIf you want to play a character who values community and survives the sea through effort alone, you should play an athamaru.",

Minotaurs are large, strong, and masters of crafts and puzzles, inclinations that lead many minotaurs to explore architecture and stonework. Minotaurs are most at home in labyrinths, whether natural, artificial, or psychological._\n\nMinotaurs stalk complex passageways, whether natural or artificial, and are masters of stone architecture. Inquisitive and steadfast, these bovine [humanoids](link_trait_2399) spend their lives perfecting the pursuit that calls to them, which can sometimes lead them far from the enclaves where they were raised. Minotaurs are originally from the Iblydos archipelago but have spread far and wide across Golarion, forming close-knit communities often near mountains or beneath the surface of the earth. Though sometimes mistaken for simple brutes, minotaurs have scholars and warriors alike. Those who can look past their appearance will find an affinity for building and navigation, as well as creative problem-solving.\n\nThe myth many minotaurs tell of their origins is one of craft, [curses](link_trait_1855), and misunderstanding. Millennia ago, Iblydos was filled with living deities who walked among and ruled the mortal people. A stonemason named Tavdrinos, admired by mortals and hero-gods alike, received a vision from a hero-god to create a glorious temple, though the myth doesn't name which one. The mason found the images of the vision murky: scrambled glimpses of twisting columns, charging bulls, and a defiant stand made by an unknown figure. It was hardly a detailed commission, but one does not refuse a divine order. The mason labored for 17 years before his task was done. The three-story temple celebrated the glory of the hero-god and their sacred animal, the bull. Upon the hero-god's arrival, Tavdrinos expected to be met with praise and congratulations, but the deity flew into a rage instead. Tavdrinos had misunderstood the vision, for the bull was a hated [beast](link_trait_2422), not a celebrated ally. As punishment for this accidental insult, the hero-god cursed Tavdrinos with the hated shape of the bull. Angered by both the curse and his failure to please the deity, the mason retreated to a series of caves under the temple, where he continued his work as the first minotaur.\n\nIf you want to play a character with strength of body, who expresses themselves through craft more than words, you should play a minotaur.",

        "description": "> _Surkis are only now emerging from the subterranean Darklands in a generational dig to the surface. This insectile and highly metamorphic species subsists on the latent magic in the world around them. Once they have refined enough, surkis are capable of developing unique adaptations that allow them to project magic in diverse ways, from digging claws to energized wings._\n\nSurkis are an insectile species who subsist on the latent magic in the world around them. As a subterranean species native to the Darklands, surkis have rarely been seen on the surface, and always with long pauses between historical sightings. This is due to surkis' life cycle—long dormancies followed by so-called “generation digs,” as they migrate great distances in response to happenings underground. The healing of the Worldwound initiated one of the largest such digs in their history, bringing surkis up into the caverns and passages of the Sarkoris Scar and emerging onto the surface for the first time in many years. Since their emergence, several small surki settlements have been established in secluded corners of Sarkoris, voraciously cataloging the wildlife, magics, and various other inhabitants of the area as they explore the alien environment of the surface.\n\nRather than consuming food conventionally, surkis are filter feeders, absorbing magic from the air, soil, plants, stone, and practically any other material. This magic is refined and sequestered in nodes throughout a surki's body over the course of their life cycle, which is comprised of three distinct phases: larva, adult, and evolved. At each stage, surkis use their stockpiled magic to undergo a dramatic metamorphosis into their next stage of life, evolving adaptations that will help them survive in any environment. Surkis therefore vary dramatically on an individual level; each surki tells the story of their adventures and their chosen role in the environment in their unique combination of adaptations.\n\nIf you want to play a character who's exploring Golarion for the first time, with limitless adaptability and a strong tie to magic, you should play a surki.",

        "description": "> _Centaurs are half-human, half-horse nomads who range wild and free across their ancestral lands. They're survivalists with a long history of teaching and instruction who stand firm in the face of danger using their skill at archery, herbalism, and magic._\n\nCentaurs are proud nomads who range far and wide across their ancestral territories, protecting their lands from exploitation and intrusion. They are survivalists who forge tight bonds with family and community and stand firm in the face of danger. Many are skilled hunters, trackers, and warriors who do battle with bow, steel, and hooves. Brave and stubborn, they're willing to challenge even the fiercest foes and largest forces to protect their homes, kin, and the land within their domain.\n\nAs hunter-gatherers, centaurs rely upon the bounty of the natural world for sustenance. As youths, they're taught to nurture and respect their surrounding ecosystems so the land remains healthy and bountiful throughout their lives and is preserved for future generations. Centaurs understand that a land exploited or despoiled is a land unfit for survival, just as a herd overhunted dies off. In the ancient past, such carelessness and greed resulted in malnutrition, famine, and loss of territory, and most centaurs are careful not to repeat the mistakes of their distant forbears. Thus, centaurs prefer to adapt to their surroundings, rather than abuse their environments for their own comfort. They're guardians of nature, and their beliefs lead them to clash with careless urbanites and expansionists over exploitative and dangerous practices, including overhunting, overlogging, pollution, and city development.\n\nCentaurs are happiest when mobile, and many feel restless or fall ill if cooped up or sedentary for too long. They're fond of racing and athletics, and are aggressively competitive, always striving to best their previous achievements and to outdo their fellows. This often results in centaurs being judged as contentious and boorish by outsiders. Most centaurs enjoy physical contests, particularly team sports, and award small but valued tokens to victors—though for many centaurs, bragging rights are the greatest prize of all. Not all centaurs compete as athletes, but most centaurs enjoy exertion and take naturally to activities that get their blood pumping and their heart racing.\n\nIf you want to play a character who runs free and proud, always looking out for their companions, you should play a centaur.",

You lived from moment to moment, never questioning what comes next or pondering the ramifications of what happened before. You were at one with the wild. Then came the event that changed everything. You drank from a glowing lake, someone pulled a [magical](link_trait_1504) prank, a druid sought to elevate your mind. You were pulled out of the present moment of the wild and into a land of thought.  \n  \nFor the first time, you realized you had a past. For the first time, you started to think about your future. Now you experience the world in a whole new way. You become aware of dangers that never occurred to you before, but there are pleasures and wonders aplenty in this new world, too. That's a good thing, because there's no going back to how things were.  \n  \nAwakened animals were normal [animals](link_trait_2409) that underwent an experience that awakened their minds, giving them full intelligence and the ability to perceive the world through a lens of thought. There are many mysterious ways for animals to awaken, but the most well-known path is through the [awaken animal](link_spell_4408) ritual.\n\nEvery animal takes the process of awakening differently. For some, the opening of their mind is electric, allowing them to perceive and ponder the world like never before. Others are overwhelmed by emotions and thoughts that they didn't ask for and weren't ready to hold. Most people who would awaken an animal assume that the animal they awaken will be full of wonder and gratitude and aren't prepared for the wide variety of responses they receive: shock, sadness, euphoria, curiosity, and anger are common (but not the only ones).\n\nNo matter how an awakened animal reacts, they still must find their way in the world. Some awakened animals try to go back to their lives but almost always find themselves disconnected from their unawakened peers. Others embrace the civilized world entirely, doing their best to navigate a world built for [humanoids](link_trait_2399). Over time, awakened animals find themselves moving between both the civilized world and the wild, for each holds only a part of what they need from life.\n\nIf you want to play a character who is extremely outside the norm and crosses between the civilized and natural worlds, you should play an awakened animal.",

On their own, kobolds are ingenious crafters and devoted allies, but outsiders who trespass into their territory find them to be inspired skirmishers and clever ambushers. However, these reptilian opportunists prove happy to cooperate with other [humanoids](link_trait_2399) when it's to their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make their fortunes in the wider world.\n\nIf you want a character with deadly cunning and who bears the mark of a powerful benefactor, you should play a kobold.",

They believe that strong communities, breadth of experience, and continual self-improvement aid them in this fight.\n\nAs quick as their reflexes are, catfolk have quicker tempers, shifting from effusive glee to aggrieved fury in an instant. Like mundane felines, catfolk involuntarily purr when pleased and growl when surprised or angry.\n\nIf you want a character who is curious, brave, friendly, and nimble in body and mind, you should play a catfolk.",

Now under strict orders to not start conflicts with other nations, these hobgoblins have begun to cautiously investigate in the spirit of cooperation rather than conquest. Many people, especially those who suffered terrible cruelties caused by hobgoblins, fear that this is simply a pause in aggression while Oprak gains enough strength to crush its rivals. Others hope these bold soldiers might prove to be powerful allies.",

They're good with their hands and have a keen eye for spotting anything out of the ordinary, from threats to treasures. They're also inveterate hoarders; ysoki warrens are crammed full of unusual odds and ends gathered by previous generations and stowed away in preparation for some future emergency.\n\nIf you want a character who is smart, fast, well-traveled, and adaptable, try playing a ratfolk!",

Any loss of a kholo affects not just the individual, but their packmates and kin as well. Wasting time on anything but victory, whether it's mercy or cruelty, is seen as little shy of immoral. Kholo are masters of ambushes, tactical feints, and psychological warfare. Equally misunderstood is the kholo practice of ancestor worship and endocannibalism. Kholo consume their dead as a sign of reverence, holding a grand feast and transforming the bones into art or weapons. Kholo extend this honor to respected foes, hoping to bring their enemy's cunning or strength into the clan.",

In maritime regions, tengu notably work as fishers, blacksmiths, and “jinx eaters”—members of ships’ crews who are believed, accurately or otherwise, to absorb misfortune. Having lived in a variety of conditions and locations, tengu tend to be nonjudgmental, though their willingness to associate with lawbreakers has often led some to regard them with suspicion.\n\nIf you want to play a character hailing from a rich history of artisanship and tradition, but who happily picks up new practices as needed, you should play a tengu.",

        "description": "> Androids first emerged as synthetic beings crafted by many technologically advanced civilizations throughout the galaxy. The first androids were created by humanoid peoples in their own images, but after the technology that animated the living constructs spread, androids began displaying a fantastic diversity of forms. Androids in the Pact Worlds were originally designed as servants, but today androids stand as equals to other citizens under the Pact. Many androids have formed their own independent communities, while others integrate seamlessly into Pact Worlds societies. Unlike many other technological constructs, androids are more than intricate synthetic organs and complex programming, and each possesses their own soul.\n\nAndroids thrive in nearly any environment and exist as part of myriad cultures, meaning they can be found almost anywhere in the galaxy. Many androids are curious about their origins, traveling alone or with others in search of answers to a variety of metaphysical and material questions about their identities and the greater cosmos. Androids are diverse, with few individuals sharing the exact same appearance, despite their manufactured state. If you want to roleplay a character on a journey of self-discovery, you should play an android.",

With roots on countless worlds, ysoki work alongside larger species helping to establish communities and accomplish tough tasks. From the largest of crowds to the tightest of tunnels, a ysoki always knows how to find their way. Only the foolish overlook the presence of a ysoki in a group!\n\nYsoki populations thrived on Akiton, lost Golarion, and several other worlds for millennia before spaceflight accelerated cultural exchange in the Pact Worlds system. The question of whether these ethnicities share common ancestors or were examples of convergent evolution isn’t important to most ysoki. Often gregarious, ysoki embrace far-flung “cousins” regardless of differences in appearance and heredity. Most ysoki love technology and travel, even gravitating toward professions that others find unpleasant. Ysoki often work as junkers, long-haul starship crew members, or mechanics squeezing through cramped station corridors, so sure of their own worth that living and working in subpar conditions is often a source of pride rather than shame.\n\nIf you want a character who is adventurous, confident, and curious, try playing a ysoki!",

Ambitious, creative, and endlessly curious, humans maintain a robust presence in the galaxy, often taking on positions of leadership or acting at the forefront of exploration. Today, humans can be found almost anywhere, doing almost anything.\n\nHuman ambition has created empires throughout the stars. The Pact Worlds have a strong human presence, and the expansion of the Azlanti Star Empire is a more sinister expression of humanity’s potential. Though the Azlanti Star Empire is considered a bastion of oppression, there are countless diverse and inclusive societies established by humanity across the galaxy, and humans played a role in founding the most famous port in the known cosmos: Absalom Station. Regardless of their motives, humans thrive in both urban sprawls and in the most remote galactic frontiers.\n\nIf you want an adaptable character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.",

Colorful in both appearance and personality, skittermanders are excitable and altruistic. They crave community and collaboration and adore making new friends. Regardless of how, skittermanders are always thrilled to help out and lend a hand, and are known throughout the galaxy for their compassion and selflessness.\n\nThanks to their desire to help, skittermanders tend to be curious and nosy, and often insert themselves into other people’s business and problems. They’re easily distracted and prone to becoming so engrossed in aiding others that they neglect their own responsibilities and leave their own tasks unfinished. This has given skittermanders a reputation for being flighty, forgetful, or irresponsible.\n\nIf you want to play a character who is friendly, excitable, and loves to help others, you should play a skittermander.",

Vesk tend to embrace conflict and respect strength and military might._\n\nVesk have a long history of conflict, first as conquerors within their own star system and later clashing with neighboring stellar powers such as the Pact Worlds and the Swarm. Currently, the Veskarium is poised on the brink of war with the Azlanti Star Empire. Conflict permeates most aspects of vesk cultures, creating powerful militaristic empires devoted to the bloody worship of their warrior god Damoritosh. Vesk are shaped by their brutal history and militaristic values, often embracing conflict and valuing strength, duty, and honor. Individual vesk are just as likely to apply these cultural values to other aspects of life besides battle, notably in business and sport, and vesk may abandon or oppose the ruthless values enforced by the rulers of their homeworlds entirely. It’s up to each vesk to claim their role as a conqueror or a collaborator—or something else entirely.\n\nIf you want a character who is duty bound, honorable, and stoic, you should play a vesk.",

Striving for cosmic balance in all things, kasathas take pride in tempering their technological advances with the wisdom of their ancestors.\n\nKasathas are originally from the desert planet of Kasath, a doomed world orbiting a red giant. Shortly after the period of lost history known as the Gap, kasatha leaders realized their planet was dying and made a plan to leave Kasath and settle on the distant red world in the Golarion system known as Akiton. Centuries later, they arrived in the Pact Worlds system aboard the worldship Idari, only to find a thriving planet already inhabited by multitudes of other species. Most kasathas decided to stay onboard the Idari, while others peacefully emigrated to the many planets of the Pact Worlds, where their scientific and metaphysical knowledge is a welcomed addition to the diverse star system. Today, kasathas are found throughout the Pact Worlds and even in several Near Space systems.\n\nIf you want a character who strives for balance and harmony, you should play a kasatha.",

Lashuntas manipulate their own genetics at puberty, allowing each individual to develop into an enhanced scholar or warrior, though not every lashunta commits to these traditional choices.\n\nLashuntas are natural psychics with adaptive genetics who traditionally develop into one of two heritages at puberty: damayas or korashas. They have a well-earned reputation for being ambitious, driven, and self-reflective, with a perpetual desire for growth—both in terms of personal advancement and self-improvement. This cultural push to know oneself, embrace one’s strengths, surpass one’s past successes, and strive for ever-greater goals drives lashuntas to value education, focus, and training, and to embrace new discoveries, technologies, and modes of thought. While many lashuntas today still fulfill the traditional role of the enlightened warrior or the consummate scholar, time and shifting social norms have gifted lashuntas the freedom to branch out in countless ways, developing their own interests, hobbies, and genetic expressions, with no regard to their heritage or societal standing.\n\nIf you want to play a character who strives for self-perfection and has innate psychic abilities, you should play a lashunta.",

Recently, pahtra freedom fighters defeated the last Veskarium occupiers, then voted to join the Pact Worlds as a sovereign planet. Today, Pulonis is a lush, verdant world wracked by dangerous magnetic storms and scarred by the Veskarium’s brutal invasion. The struggles of survival have influenced many pahtra traditions, leading to a culture of competitive war games, time-honored mysticism, and unorthodox technology. Music accompanies everything in pahtra culture, from popular entertainment to traditional battle tactics, with martial combat even categorized as a form of battle dance.\n\nIf you want to play a character who fights for freedom with grace and style, you should play a pahtra.",

        "description": "> _Samsarans, as the tale goes, originated with a group of scholars in Zi Ha who ventured into the mountains to find the cure for an illness ravaging their village. After weeks of peril, they found a freshwater spring filled with pure magical life essence. This water brought the scholars back from the brink of death and cured the villagers. Given a new chance at life, everyone who drank the water devoted the rest of their life to learning and experiencing the world fully. Upon death, this devotion, combined with the magical essence now infused in their bodies, transformed these people into the first samsarans._\n\nSamsarans dedicate themselves to achieving enlightenment—a true understanding of everything and everyone in the world around and beyond them. Unlike duskwalkers, samsarans reincarnate many times over, with some accumulating thousands of lived lives. This cycle of reincarnation continues until the individual samsaran achieves this goal of enlightenment, or irrevocably fails at making any progress toward it. At that time, a samsaran’s soul passes onto the Great Beyond, and their body melts into pure water. For those samsarans who succeeded at enlightenment, they find a time of peace and satisfaction in the afterlife. Those who have failed instead encounter an afterlife filled with misery, punishment, reminders of past failure, or in extreme cases, nothing, leaving the souls to waste away for the rest of time.\n\nWhile samsarans can recall parts of their past incarnations, these recollections often feel like half-remembered dreams. By combining these snippets of memories from the past with new knowledge from their current life span, samsarans can view and connect with the world in entirely unique ways. The detachment that comes with countless lifetimes sometimes makes it difficult for samsarans to empathize and connect with others, however.\n\nIf you want to play a character who experiences a repeated cycle of existence, seeking out new knowledge and experiences as you walk a path to learning everything you can about the universe, you should play a samsaran.",

        "description": "> _Away from shining citadels and opulent palaces, reticent yakshas shelter Tian Xia’s rural hinterlands from natural disasters and otherworldly depredations. Famed for resolute vows and prowess with primal magic, yakshas shield the indigent and protect the wilderness, punishing those who threaten either with bone-crushing fury. Yaksha legends recall their origins as divine spirits, overseeing the safety of roads and abodes in a primeval world of vast storm forests and titanic flame floods—the First World, a realm of boundless potentiality._\n\nDuring the Great Abandonment, when the gods left the First World, many yakshas rejected this exodus, instead staying to perform their duties as caretakers. Despite the realm’s sudden dearth of [divine](link_trait_1475) power, the remaining yakshas swore primordial vows, allowing them to channel power from the nearby Creation’s Forge into primal magic and transform swathes of the metamorphic First World into stable regions to provide refuge for destitute [fey](link_trait_2021).\n\nYakshas faced great hostility in the First World; their sheltering of impoverished fey didn’t garner sympathy but instead drew scorn from others. Affronted fey aristocrats saw yaksha sanctuaries as a challenge to their authority, and the stolid plainness of yaksha domains offended the fey’s aesthetic sensitivities. Thus, yaksha communities increasingly became targets and, at some uncertain time, were banished to the Universe. Some of these exiles came to settle in obscurity amid Tian Xia’s forests, a fact that planar scholars record as a tragedy. After all, if these yakshas had left alongside the gods earlier, they would surely enjoy greater prominence and privilege on Golarion.\n\nYet most yakshas spurn such sentiments, instead expressing quiet pride in fulfilling their vows where even the gods failed. Yakshas view their departure not as a dereliction, but an execution of duty. Their histories claim this egress paved the way for other persecuted fey to escape, and thus their relocation aligned with their obligations. Many yakshas still enjoy amicable relations with fey emigrants, protecting them and their descendants from First World pursuers. Just as many wander bucolic back roads and shadowy swamps, guiding lost travelers, repairing flood-torn bridges, or simply nurturing the green, growing [earth](link_trait_1523)—a fundamental pillar of the land. Such stalwart custodianship has earned the reclusive yakshas a reputation for being hospitable, if enigmatic, guardians of the wild.\n\nIf you want to play a character who’s a guardian [spirit](link_trait_1556) and has complex relationships with gods and [fiends](link_trait_2415) alike, swears primordial vows to uphold noble duties, and acts on behalf of the humble and forgotten, you should play a yaksha.",

        "description": "> _Sarangay are carabao-headed people who have long survived deep in the forests across Tian Xia. Many adventurers have thought them to be monsters at first, but sarangay are nothing more than a thriving society who value their community and their souls above all else._\n\nTheir cultures are built upon the intense desire to protect their communities and their chosen leader. Their horns are said to be a crescent moon, and their towering statures are said to have come from their ancestors being stretched so far up to reach their Father Moon while their Mother Earth kept them close to her bosom. They revere the great Father Moon, their First Ancestor, and endeavor to protect and exalt nature above all else, for they understand that they’re part of it.\n\nSarangay tend to be rare and appear even rarer within the diverse confines of adventuring cities. When they leave their society, it’s typically because they either have a duty to fulfill or they must depart in order to save their community. In the rising chaos of the modern lands of Tian Xia, more sarangay have begun to venture out into the world, either preemptively investigating potential threats or facing a breakdown in their own societies. The most tragic sarangay are those who wander alone because they have nothing and no one to protect and care for.\n\nIf you want to play a character who is at home in the wild, possesses inherent [occult](link_trait_1514) power, is sharply aware of their impressive strength, and comes from a proud culture, you should play a sarangay.",

Often originating from an infusion of ambient energy into their original form, yaoguai attain their powers through training their innate magic._\n\nTaking care not to expose their true appearance and nature, yaoguai of the same origins or species sometimes form enclaves in which they dedicate their lives to honing their powers or engaging in hedonistic pursuits—though the two aren’t mutually exclusive. Yaoguai who lack a solid community, meanwhile, feel compelled to cultivate themselves until they transcend their origin, which might allow them to join society and experience a new kind of freedom.\n\nSometimes, extraplanar beings or [humanoids](link_trait_2399) are transformed into yaoguai by rituals, [arcane](link_trait_1459) mishaps, or sheer coincidence. For some, this occurrence was their heart’s desire, though others see their transformation as [divine](link_trait_1475) punishment for a misdeed they committed. For those wishing to change back, a long journey of atonement or discovery lies ahead, while those who accept their new forms seek ways to solidify their control over these innate gifts and amass power.\n\nIf you want to play a character who seeks to change themself fundamentally through power, experience, or transcendence, you should play a yaoguai.",

        "description": "> _Tian Xia is replete with magically gifted ancestries—such as tengu, kitsune, yakshas, and yaoguai—whose powers bring them high regard and who, in turn, use their gifts for responsible ends. Tanuki aren’t one of these ancestries. Instead, the shapeshifting raccoon dog–like humanoids use their powers of illusion and transformation in ways more people should: for fun!_\n\nTanuki delight in pranks and practical jokes, especially those that allow them to take the high and mighty down a notch and show them what life is like for everyone else. Where other peoples take pride in their storied histories, noble traditions, or intricate ceremonies, tanuki take pride in their simplicity and disregard for the world’s many rules. Though some might claim this outlook reduces tanuki to uncouth rubes, tanuki feel it makes them more cultured; after all, one must know a rule to bend it, and one must understand a norm to break it.\n\nThat being said, their laid-back natures can cause tanuki, and others, no end of trouble. Their focus on living in the moment can often mean they’re brought low by a problem they could’ve solved earlier with little effort. At the end of the day, tanuki rarely come out on top, and even their victories tend to be mixed with small defeats or embarrassment. A tanuki bard might save the day with the power of his music, but only because he played so off-key that bandits mistook him for a fearsome ghost. Tanuki are usually just fine with such an outcome, though. There’s a truth to the world that tanuki know in their bellies: that the ups and downs of life are all just a big joke, and if everyone’s going to be made a fool in the end, you might as well be the fool who gets to dance and have fun along the way! Life’s a party, and tanuki intend to enjoy it as much as they can before their luck inevitably runs out.\n\nIf you want to play a character who loves to have fun—occasionally at another’s or your own expense—who’s always up for a party and perhaps a bit too clever for their own good, you should play a tanuki.",

        "description": "> _Wayangs are diasporic sojourners from the Netherworld where they lived and worked alongside their allies, light-weaving d’ziriaks. Both peoples shared affinities for artistic expression and spiritual introspection, inspiring each other’s sensitivities to color, form, and function; they also bolstered each other’s defense against rampaging dragons, oni, and undead._\n\nThis idyll collapsed from divine meddling; some say when Abadar sentenced Zon-Kuthon to exile in the Netherworld, the Midnight Lord’s deific presence distorted the plane into a nightmarish domain, while others accounts ascribe [fiendish](link_trait_2415) sources to this doom.\n\nWhatever the reason, wayang and d’ziriak communities suffered terribly; Kuthites and [velstracs](link_trait_3969) colonized the Netherworld, engulfing it in religious wars of slaughter and brutality—an ongoing catastrophe that wayangs and d’ziriaks refer to as the Desecration. Despite both peoples’ valorous resistance, with every generation, space and resources became scarcer. When the Age of Ashes created passageways between the Netherworld and Golarion, many wayangs sailed away for a better life.\n\nThese curious wayfarers became Tian Xia’s first wayangs, who shared their skills and labor to eke out a solidarity of subsistence with Earthfall’s survivors. These explorers also observed how Tian Xia’s suffering souls weakened barriers to the Netherworld, whose malignant overlords absorbed the negative emotions to grow in power. While disappointments, melancholia, and other negative experiences were part and parcel of existence, the engineers of the Desecration exploited mortal emotions to oppress both the Universe and its [shadow](link_trait_1901) Netherworlds.\n\nRealizing these planar interconnections, wayang leaders reached a bold conclusion: no world is free until all worlds are. To prevent the Netherworlds’ colonial oppressors from harnessing mortal souls and to reclaim the darkness from its present state of malice and anguish, more wayang expeditions arrived in Tian Xia with exorcists and [curse](link_trait_1855)\\-breakers to purify paths to the Netherworld and starve its despots of spiritual power. Toward this end, wayang sages devised the Dissolution, a philosophy of drawing strength and peace from one’s inner darkness. They shared their teachings discreetly with those in Tian Xia touched by [darkness](link_trait_1900), instead of leaving such people to be preyed upon by velstracs and other depraved entities.\n\nIf you want to play a character who is at home in the shadows of Tian Xia’s oceans and jungles, is heir to mystic and martial arts drawing upon the Netherworld’s untainted power, and pursues obscure struggles against dark forces, you should play a wayang.",

These aquatic humanoids have art and creativity at the center of their culture, and they employ fluid fighting styles in combat.\n\nKalos are from Kalo-Mahoi, a watery moon of Bretheda where they’ve lived in relative peace and safety since throwing off the rule of wicked linnorm oppressors. Though the last of the linnorms were killed long ago, kalos remain vigilant in military training and traditions. Their fearsome reputation keeps kalo soldiers and mercenaries in high demand.\n\nToday, kalos thrive in dense, expanding cities clustered around warm geothermal vents on the ocean floor. Artists, performers, inventors, and creators of custom goods find a ready market in Kalo-Mahoi’s seas. Visitors come from all over the Pact Worlds to explore the galleries, fashion houses, and submarine vistas of these bright, colorful urban centers.\n\nIf you want a character who’s tough, creative, and one of a kind, try playing a kalo!",

At once proud of their history and keen to embrace a brighter future, sarcesians are patient survivors who embrace individualism and the joys of exploration while maintaining connections to their communities and homes. Motivated by a natural love of travel, sarcesians often train as pilots and navigators; rare is the sarcesian who isn’t comfortable in the cockpit. Despite their positive outlooks and easygoing natures, some harbor an innate suspicion of inhabitants of the neighboring planet Eox, for it was an Eoxian attack that destroyed their ancestral home worlds in ages long past.\n\nSarcesians can survive in space by suspending their respiration and shielding their bodies from the dangers of the void. They manifest a pair of butterfly-like wings made of pure energy that function as solar sails. The sight of a sarcesian in flight is magnificent, and the first dwarven and ysoki miners who met them described encounters with “void angels”.\n\nThroughout their lives, sarcesians learn control over the energies surrounding them—particularly energy of cosmic origin.

        "description": "> Draconic in appearance and fiercely loyal, dragonkin are deeply empathic beings capable of forming a nearly unbreakable spiritual bond with one other creature, which manifests in telepathic communication and tactical synergy.\n\nDraconic in appearance and fiercely loyal, dragonkin are deeply empathic beings capable of forming a nearly unbreakable spiritual bond with one other creature, which manifests in telepathic communication and tactical synergy.\n\nThe first dragonkin were born from deep bonds of love between dragons and humanoids using complex rituals and special materials found only on the planet Triaxus. It’s been millennia since the first dragonkin were born, and they have long since disconnected from dragons—they have their own cultural traditions, societies, and lineages, independent of their distant draconic forebears. Despite the ages, the love that gave birth to them endures in the partner bond—a deep spiritual connection that every dragonkin can forge with one other person.\n\nOn the surface, a partner bond is a telepathic connection forged through emotion. It enables a bonded pair to communicate telepathically and react as one, providing advantages in battle, sport, and countless other avenues. Looking deeper, a partner bond can only be formed through mutual devotion and love—whether romantic, platonic, or familial—and is nigh unbreakable. It’s not a bond to be entered into frivolously, nor can it be forced or severed by anything other than death or the will of the gods. While the tactical applications of a partner bond are extensive, it can never be “turned off” or ignored, and all outside relationships must bend to accommodate it—rarely is there a loyalty that partners place above one another.\n\nDragonkin are extremely social. Their innate empathy and intuition makes them simultaneously cautious and earnest; they tend to approach new people and situations with care, form an opinion rapidly, then trust their own gut judgment, even if it might conflict with the opinions of others or cause strife. A dragonkin’s behavior is usually tempered by their sense of duty and responsibility. A dragonkin with few connections—or who shows little regard for others—can cause a lot of havoc.\n\nIf you want to play a character who is strong and resilient, embraces their emotions, and forms deep bonds of friendship and community, you should play a dragonkin.",

They have an incredible sense of smell and are often born deaf, blind, or deafblind.\n\nOriginally from Lajok, a frigid world orbiting a dying sun, vlakas became stellar nomads to survive. Now, Lajok’s sun has miraculously rekindled, sparking strange solar powers within vlakas born under its light.\n\nVlakas have a reputation for being contemplative, even-tempered, and understanding. Despite long ages spent watching the inevitable death of their world, they keep a positive outlook and an open mind. Though not self-sacrificing, they’re willing to go to great lengths to help their family, friends, and colleagues, and they tend to emphasize the well-being of the group over that of the individual.\n\nWhile all vlakas share a keen sense of smell and touch, their other senses vary wildly. Deaf, blind, and deafblind vlakas are all born frequently. Vlakas are good at reading emotions and social cues, and they find it easy to make friends with others.\n\nIf you want to play an open-minded and well-intentioned traveler who strives to do good throughout the galaxy, you should play a vlaka.",

Their natural telekinesis propels them through the air as their measured curiosity drives them to discovery and innovation.\n\nAs Akiton’s core cooled and its atmosphere thinned, contemplatives’ distant ancestors sought shelter in underground sanctuaries. Life underground was incredibly different than on the surface, and though today no one knows what the first contemplatives might have looked like or what their cultural traditions might have been, those who weathered their planet’s changes realized they would need to change to adapt to the new paradigm. And thus contemplatives turned away from the laborious routines of farming, hunting, and building on the surface. Instead, they began to explore a new frontier: the esoteric realms of the mind.\n\nThrough magically guided evolution, each generation grew larger brains and frailer bodies, dedicating themselves to the pursuit of knowledge rather than the struggle for survival. Today, contemplatives are hyper-specialized thinkers, able to unravel secrets at a whim and reflexively generate psychic forces. Space travel has lured many of the reclusive philosophers from their isolated Akitonian communes, promising them countless discoveries and data beyond the stars.\n\nIf you want to play a mental powerhouse with innate psychic abilities, you should play a contemplative.",

Shirrens are a species of telepaths devoted to their own individualism, building chosen communities, and living in harmony with other peoples.\n\nShirrens were originally members of the Swarm, a collection of colonies controlled by a hive mind that devoured entire planets. In time, shirrens gained a sense of individual self and rejected the Swarm's mindless consumption. They fled the hive mind and settled in the Pact Worlds, where they established their own communities and integrated into existing settlements.\n\nIf you want a character who enjoys working as part of a team while still valuing independence, you should play a shirren.",

Skittermanders accomplish tasks with chaotic enthusiasm and typically enjoy teamwork, defying even their would-be conquerors through collaboration.\n\nSkittermanders are the original inhabitants of Oeddertchonk, a planet that the Veskarium invaded long before the Gap and is more commonly known today as Vesk-3. Colorful in both appearance and personality, skittermanders are generally energetic and altruistic.\n\nMost skittermanders quickly form new friendships, typically enjoy staying busy, and seek collaboration. Skittermanders are traditionally raised to always lend “allsix” hands to help a friend or stranger. Because of these values, they have a reputation throughout the galaxy for their compassion and selflessness that not every skittermander lives up to. Even the most altruistic skittermanders might be curious and nosy or insert themselves into others' business and problems as though they belong there. If you want to play a character who's friendly and emotional and who enjoys helping others, you should play a skittermander.",

With roots on countless worlds, ysoki work alongside larger species, helping to establish communities and accomplish tough tasks. From the largest of crowds to the tightest of tunnels, a ysoki always knows how to find their way.\n\nYsoki populations thrived on Akiton, lost Golarion, and several other worlds for millennia before spaceflight accelerated cultural exchange in the Pact System. The question of whether these ethnicities share common ancestors or were examples of convergent evolution isn't important to most ysoki. Often gregarious, ysoki embrace far-flung “cousins” regardless of differences in appearance and heredity.\n\nMost ysoki love technology and travel, even gravitating toward professions that others find unpleasant. Ysoki often work as junkers, long-haul starship crew members, or mechanics squeezing through cramped station corridors, so sure of their own worth that living and working in subpar conditions is often a source of pride rather than shame.\n\nIf you want a character who's adventurous, confident, and curious, you should play a ysoki.",

The first androids were created by humanoid peoples in their own images, but after the technology that animated the living constructs spread, androids began displaying a fantastic diversity of forms. Androids in the Pact Worlds were originally designed as servants, but today androids and other robotic beings stand as equals to organic ancestries under the Pact. Some androids have formed their own independent communities, while most integrate seamlessly into Pact Worlds societies. Unlike many other technological constructs, androids are more than intricate synthetic organs and complex programming, and each possesses their own soul.\n\nAndroids thrive in nearly any environment and exist as part of countless cultures, meaning they can be found almost anywhere in the galaxy. Many androids are curious about their origins, traveling alone or with others in search of answers to a variety of metaphysical and material questions about their identities and the greater cosmos. Androids are diverse, with few individuals sharing the exact same appearance, despite their manufactured state.\n\nIf you want to roleplay a synthetic character on a journey of self-discovery, you should play an android.",

        "description": "> Steeped in the ancient traditions of a distant home world orbiting a dying star, kasathas are four-armed humanoids who arrived in the Pact Worlds aboard a massive worldship named Idari. Striving for cosmic balance in all things, kasathas take pride in tempering their technological advances with the wisdom of their ancestors.\n\nKasathas are originally from the desert planet of Kasath, a doomed world orbiting a red giant. Shortly after the period of lost history known as the Gap, kasatha leaders realized their planet was dying and made a plan to leave Kasath and settle on the distant red world in the Pact System known as Akiton. Centuries later, they arrived aboard the worldship Idari to find a thriving planet already inhabited by multitudes of other species. Most kasathas decided to stay on board the Idari, while others peacefully emigrated to the many planets of the Pact Worlds, where their scientific and metaphysical knowledge are welcomed additions to the diverse star system. Today, kasathas are found throughout the Pact Worlds and even in several Near Space systems.\n\nIf you want a character who strives for balance and harmony, you should play a kasatha.",

Vesk tend to embrace conflict and respect strength and military might.\n\nVesk have a long history of conflict, first as conquerors within their own star system and later clashing with neighboring stellar powers such as the Pact Worlds and the Swarm. Currently, the Veskarium is at war with the Azlanti Star Empire. Conflict permeates most aspects of vesk cultures, creating powerful militaristic empires devoted to the bloody worship of their warrior god Damoritosh. Their brutal history and militaristic values shape vesk, who often embrace conflict and value strength, duty, and a personal code of honor. Individual vesk are just as likely to apply these cultural values to other aspects of life besides battle, notably in business and sport, and some vesk might abandon or oppose the ruthless values enforced by the rulers of their home worlds entirely. It's up to each vesk to claim their role as a conqueror or a collaborator—or something else entirely.\n\nIf you want a character who's duty bound, brave, and stoic, you should play a vesk.",

        "description": "> Long ago, lashuntas evolved psychic abilities and a unique dimorphism that helped them survive on their home world of Castrovel. In modern times, lashuntas manipulate their own genetics at puberty, allowing each individual to develop into an enhanced scholar or warrior, though not every lashunta commits to these traditional choices.\n\nLashuntas are natural psychics with adaptive genetics who traditionally develop into one of two heritages at puberty: damayas or korashas. They have a well-earned reputation for being charismatic, driven, and self-reflective, with a perpetual desire for growth—both in terms of personal advancement and self-improvement. This cultural push to know oneself, embrace one's strengths, surpass one's past successes, and strive for ever\u0002greater goals drives lashuntas to value education, focus, and training as well as to explore new discoveries, technologies, and modes of thought. While many lashuntas today still fulfill the traditional role of the enlightened warrior or the consummate scholar, time and shifting social norms have gifted lashuntas the freedom to branch out in countless ways, developing their own interests, hobbies, and genetic expressions, with no regard to their heritage or societal standing.\n\nIf you want to play a character who strives for self-improvement and has innate psychic abilities, you should play a lashunta.",

Their home world was recently freed from the Veskarium's occupation, and they've joined the Pact Worlds.\n\nPahtras evolved on a low-gravity jungle world called Pulonis, where they fought a long war for independence from their Veskarium conquerors. Recently, pahtra freedom fighters defeated the last Veskarium occupiers, then voted to join the Pact Worlds as a sovereign planet. Today, Pulonis is a lush, verdant world wracked by dangerous magnetic storms and scarred by the Veskarium's brutal invasion. The struggles of survival have influenced many pahtra traditions, leading to a culture of competitive war games, time-honored mysticism, and unorthodox technology. Music accompanies everything in pahtra culture, from popular entertainment to traditional battle tactics, with martial combat even categorized as a form of battle dance.\n\nIf you want to play a character who fights for freedom with grace and style, you should play a pahtra.",

        "description": "> _According to their oldest stories, the first jotunborn were the direct creations of the earliest gods. Having just completed the majority of the creation of Golarion, these gods created several groups of people to act as stewards for this new world._\n\nAmong these groups were jotunborn, beings who were formed from the remains of titans who dared rebel against the gods in the earliest days of existence. Rather than give jotunborn the full power they gave the titans, the gods instead instilled the first jotunborn with the faintest spark of creation and gave them slighter forms. These new servitors would be just as capable at helping to shape the rest of Golarion but would also be weaker and easier to strike down should they rebel like their progenitors.\n\nFortunately for the gods, jotunborn saw no reason to rebel and dedicated themselves outright to their duties. These first jotunborn used their abilities to grow mountains, carve out rivers, and more as they continued to mold Golarion at the behest of the gods. When the task was done, the gods took the first jotunborn and placed them in the space between the mortal Universe and the Ethereal Plane. This sub-planar space sat “beneath” the surface of the Universe and served as the new home for jotunborn. The gods commanded the jotunborn to remain in this realm, watch over their creation from afar, and return to the “surface” of the Universe to tend to it during times of great need.\n\nNow, jotunborn remain mysterious beings whose existence is only briefly mentioned in scattered points throughout history. They are tasked to return to Golarion only when a major disaster—natural or otherwise—changes the world. Jotunborn then appear to assess the issue and determine what steps to take to return the world to a more stable state. This typically only draws a handful of jotunborn to the world. Earthfall caused a mass arrival of jotunborn, though their visit was brief. In the wake of the Godsrain, hundreds of jotunborn have appeared once more. Unlike past visitors, these jotunborn can’t easily return to their home. Now these gigantic humanoids must learn to adapt to life among the people of Golarion.\n\nIf you want to play a character who is a towering being with the potential of creation and has a unique connection to planar powers, you should play a jotunborn.",
