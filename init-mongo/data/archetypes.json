        "rarity": "UNCOMMON",
        "description": "It is said that the greatest heroes are often stalked by an implacable doom, the shadow cast by the light of their deeds. Such warriors of legend often garner great reputations for their prowess and ferocity in battle, spawning legends of their invincibility. These stories almost always end in tragedy, however, for the blessings that carry the warriors to victory are always accompanied by a terrible curse that all but ensures their heroic tales have grim endings.\n\nSince the Godsrain scattered divine power across Golarion, more and more tales of such legendary warriors have sprung up all over the world, from Garund to Tian Xia, Casmaron to Arcadia, and across Avistan all the way to the Crown of the World. Hallmarks of these stories include heroes and villains who prefer lighter armor, hafted weapons, and who all seem to have an aversion or vulnerability to certain types of opponents.\n\nThe would-be ruler Gulrik the Fierce slew a linnorm in the depths of the Grungir Forest but was slain by the arrows of lowly bandits before he could claim a kingdom for himself. The warrior Mohaadjii had just begun to forge a legend by driving pillagers from Bloodcove out of the Kaava Lands, when a slingstone from a halfling raider struck her dead before she even realized she was under attack.\n\nThis cursed weakness perhaps goes a long way to explaining why certain pieces of gear are so common to the figures at the center of these stories. With each warrior of legend living under the shadow of finding their doom at the hands of a particular threat, even such staunch stalwarts might prefer a weapon that gives them enough reach to assess their opponent before closing in for the kill, and armor light enough that it won’t become a burden if flight becomes the better part of valor.\n\n### Warrior of Legend (1st)\n\nYou have received a blessing that will ensure your ascension to legend, and a curse that foretells your inevitable fall. You must select Warrior of Legend Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.\n\n**Prerequisites:** You must be a fighter.\n\n**Warrior of Legend Adjustments:** You aren’t trained in heavy armor. The armor expertise and armor mastery class features only improve your proficiency rank for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense.\n\nYou don’t gain [Shield Block](link_class-feature_19228) as a class feature.\n\nYou are trained in both Acrobatics and Athletics, rather than one or the other.\n\nChoose one physical damage type, which becomes your cursed weakness: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. You gain weakness to this damage type equal to half your level (minimum 1).\n\nYou gain [Diehard](link_feat_20051) as a bonus feat, but you become doomed 2 whenever you take damage from your cursed weakness (unless your doomed value is already higher).\n\nYour [fighter weapon mastery](link_class-feature_20764) and [weapon legend](link_class-feature_19270) class features grant you increased proficiency in both spears and polearms, but you can’t choose any other weapon group with these class features.",

        "description": "There’s a balance in blood. The arteries send surges of the fresh, life-giving liquid to the furthest reaches of the body, even as the veins return spent blood to be renewed. Healthy blood contains the essences of life and energy, while unhealthy blood might be anemic or even laden with disease. Within this duality of blood is great power—to infuse energy, health, and life, or to expunge it just as quickly.  \n  \nSome individuals are sensitive to the power within blood, and in time might even begin to control it. This practice is known by magical scholars as sanguimancy to distinguish it from a sorcerer’s magical bloodline, though most people are ignorant of the distinction and use the same term—blood magic—for both. Sanguimancy is a strange and lonely path. Those who practice it are few in number, and when they do come into contact with others, people often react to them with caution, if not outright revulsion. Consequently, few actively seek out these bloody powers. Those with ties to blood, be it vampires and their associates, practitioners of bloody rites—such as worshippers of Camazotz—or even specialists in medicine can all find themselves drawn to sanguimancy.  \n  \nWhile its effects are undeniably magical, sanguimancy falls outside the established norms of spellcasting. Casters combine spells with sanguimancy to create powerful synergies, while warriors appreciate being able to wield their abilities even after their peers’ spells have run dry. The most powerful sanguimancers can wield the energies contained within blood to shield themselves from harm, cause internal bleeding, and even unleash a barrage of razor-sharp needles of blood.  \n  \nBlood sensitivity is uncommon but found in diverse places. It’s difficult to tell if someone is blood sensitive without them admitting to it or overtly manifesting their powers in public. As a result, estimates of how many members of a population are blood sensitive tend to be accurate only if sanguimancy is tolerated. Another tradition of blood magic, hemotheurgy, has many similarities to sanguimancy but carries a far different effect on its practitioners. The leech‑covered bloatmages of Kaer Maga practice this self-destructive magic, overriding their bodies’ fail-safes to produce more blood than their bodies need in order to enhance their magic.  \n  \nThe precise manner in which blood sensitivity comes about remains poorly understood, even among the magical scholars who have rigorously studied its existence. Most agree that exposure to fresh blood is a key factor in manifesting the attunement. Some speculate that repeated exposure from a young age is necessary, while others surmise a single incident might be all that’s required, provided that such an event occurs while in a state of extraordinarily heightened emotion. And, of course, some believe that blood sensitivity could be a divinely preordained gift (or curse), an affinity you’re born with, or a simple matter of luck. As of yet, no one has been able to reliably induce a test subject with the power of sanguimancy, and most experiments attempting to do so are considered evil.",

Use it wisely.\n\n**Additional Feats**: Your GM might determine that you can take a pact feat from the pactbinder archetype as an additional feat, as long as the pact is made to the entity within you.

In fact, sometimes, those who don't understand pacts like you do might mistake the payment for the benefit, or vice versa.

Of course, this practice isn't without its own risks, as who knows what you might become without that part of you.\n\nAll these things, you can and must consider in every pact.

        "rarity": "COMMON",
        "description": "You've learned how to cast spells flexibly, blending the best elements of spontaneous and prepared spellcasting at the cost of casting fewer spells each day.\n\n### **Flexible Spell Preparation**\n\nThis class feature alters your spellcasting class feature (such as [Wizard Spellcasting](link_class-feature_21238) for the wizard or [Cleric Spellcasting](link_class-feature_21195) for the cleric). If you choose this class archetype, you must select Flexible Spellcaster Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.  \n  \n**Prerequisites**: You must have a class, such as [clerics](link_class_22), [druids](link_class_23), [witches](link_class_27), and [wizards](link_class_26), that prepares spells in spell slots using the same number of prepared spells per day.  \n  \n**Flexible Spellcaster Adjustments**: You learn spells as normal for your class (a wizard uses a [spellbook](link_item_7799), a witch teaches spells to their familiar, and so on), but change your spellcasting from your class as follows.\n\n*   You can cast fewer spells each day. Your number of spell slots per day don't advance from 2 to 3 spells at even levels (see Table below).\n    \n*   Reduce the number of [cantrips](link_trait_1858) you gain from your class by 2. This archetype doesn't change the way you prepare [cantrips](link_trait_1858).\n    \n*   During your daily preparations, you prepare a spell collection rather than preparing spells into each spell slot individually. The number of spells in your spell collection each day equals the total number of spell slots you get each day from your class spells. Select these spells from the same source as normal, such as from a [spellbook](link_item_7799) for a wizard.\n    \n*   You can [cast](link_action_19611) any of the spells in your collection by using a spell slot of an appropriate level. For instance, if you were level 1 and had [_gentle landing_](link_spell_4640) and [_force barrage_](link_spell_4630) in your spell collection, you could cast [_gentle landing_](link_spell_4640) twice that day, [_force barrage_](link_spell_4630) twice, or each spell once.\n    \n*   Extra spell slots you gain that have additional restrictions, like the wizard's [arcane school](link_class-feature_21240) spells or the cleric's [divine font](link_class-feature_21194) spells, don't change due to this archetype, nor do such spells count toward the number of spells you place in your spell collection.\n    \n\n| Lvl | Can. | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th |\n\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n| 1 | 3 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n| 2 | 4 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n| 3 | 4 | 2 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n| 4 | 5 | 2 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n| 5 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n| 6 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n| 7 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n| 8 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n| 9 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n| 10 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n| 11 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | — | — | — |\n\n| 12 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | — | — | — |\n\n| 13 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | — | — |\n\n| 14 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | — | — |\n\n| 15 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | — |\n\n| 16 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — | — |\n\n| 17 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — |\n\n| 18 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | — |\n\n| 19 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1\\* |\n\n| 20 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1\\* |\n\n\\* Your class most likely has a class feature that gives you a single 10th level spell slot that works a bit differently from other slots. If so, flexible spellcaster doesn't change the way that spell works.\n\n### **Heightening Spells**\n\nOnce you gain 2nd-rank spells, you can heighten any spell in your spell collection to any rank you can [cast](link_action_19611), similar to a spontaneous spellcaster's signature spells. The only restriction is that you must select at least one 1st-rank spell for your collection each time you prepare, ensuring that you can use all your spell slots each day.\n\n### **Adjudicating Class Feats And Features**\n\nSome of your class feats or features might rely on the fact that you prepare spells in spell slots. While some class feats might no longer work or be necessary with the flexible spellcaster archetype, in many cases you can make a simple replacement and continue using the class feat. The following class feats simply require replacing “a spell you have prepared” or “a prepared spell” for “a spell in your collection” or “a spell slot.” For example, in [Counterspell](link_feat_20020), you'd replace “a spell you have prepared” in the trigger for “a spell in your collection” and “expend a prepared spell” for “expend a spell slot.” Similarly, in [arcane bond](link_class-feature_21241), you'd replace “cast one spell you prepared today and already cast” with “cast one spell in your collection you've already cast today.”\n\nThe [Counterspell](link_feat_20020) and [Leyline Conduit](link_feat_20304) feats in the _Core Rulebook_ need these substitutions, as does [Form Retention](link_feat_20172) from the _Advanced Player's Guide_. [Spell Mastery](link_feat_20573) provides additional restricted spells, like [divine font](link_class-feature_21194) or specialist spells; you can take it, but it doesn't add to your collection and works like normal prepared spells.\n\n### **Disallowed Feats**\n\nThe following feats aren't available for a flexible spellcaster: [Call of the Wild](link_feat_19974), [Clever Counterspell](link_feat_19998), [Infinite Possibilities](link_feat_20258), [Reprepare Spell](link_feat_20481), [Spell Combination](link_feat_20571), [Elemental Summons](link_feat_20105), [Miraculous Possibility](link_feat_20342), [Rites of Convocation](link_feat_20493), and [Rites of Transfiguration](link_feat_20494).",

        "name": "Beast Gunner",
        "rarity": "UNCOMMON",
        "description": "The art of creating the weapons most commonly referred to as “beast guns” is truly ancient, with the first iterations of the weapons created on the continent of Arcadia well over 10,000 years ago. This means that beast guns predate all other forms of firearm crafting in Arcadia, even the legendary star guns, whose secrets have been lost to the ages. The tradition of designing beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige associated with star guns has allowed more people access to equivalent destructive power without the intense requirements behind crafting a beast gun. However, beast gunners remain virtually unknown outside of Arcadia.\n\nThe art of bonding to a beast gun and gaining the full magic of a beast gunner is an extended ritual with multiple steps, beginning with the hunt. A person seeking to bond to a beast gun typically does so with a brand new weapon made after they hunt down the creature themselves. This involves telling the story of the hunt, the beast, and the weapon created from the hunted creature. Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the prospective beast gunner. However, it's also possible to bond to an heirloom beast gun passed down through the generations by adding symbolic fresh components from the same kind of creature, after performing the same ritual hunt necessary to forge a new weapon with the intent of establishing a bond.\n\nTo perform the ritual the prospective beast gunner must first plan a hunt to slay the creature corresponding to the beast gun, whether they wish to bond with a brand new beast gun or establish a link to an old beast gun. Typically, these ritualized hunts can include up to five assistants plus hunting beasts like canines or birds who help corner the beast and bring it down. If the assistants are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature, or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the bonding process and the hunt and organic materials are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of the hunter. The same doesn't apply if the prospective beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are significantly more powerful than the creature, such that the creature never stood a chance against them in a one on one fight.\n\nYou're one of those who successfully completed the hunt and bonded with your prized weapon. Now, you seek to discover the hidden depths that others who think they know how to use beast guns can only imagine.\n\n**Choosing Your Beast Gun**\n---------------------------\n\nA beast gunner's bond with their beast gun is deep and mystical, so if you hope to be a successful beast gunner, it's important to choose a beast gun that suits your temperament, magic, and combat style. For example, if you favor strength and intimidation, a _screech shooter_ is the right choice for you, whereas a _spider gun_ might be optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the battlefield in advance. Similarly, a _tentacle cannon_ is slow and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close range, while a _drake rifle_ is energetic and mobile and can be used to attack from a great distance. Each beast gun has a personality and magical abilities that attract people who value them. For this reason, some experienced beast gunners say the weapon chooses you.",

Your reanimated clockwork corpses are stable, effective, and, more importantly, they don't rampage or crave the flesh of the living in the same way an undead would.

You connect disparate facts to unlock deeper mysteries and uncover the truths of the universe, and you zealously hoard the knowledge your painstaking research produces. Aberrations fascinate you for many reasons, not the least of which is because their anatomy is wholly alien and yet, to the insightful, eminently sensible.\n\nYou've been particularly enlightened by the accumulated lore in _Thresholds of Truth_, and you know Zarmavdian was a kindred soul in occult research. With this book in hand, you feel like you stand at the doorway to unprecedented occult discoveries.\n\nYou scoff at those fools who claim you meddle in things mortals aren't meant to know—for isn't it the duty of the enlightened to gather the universe's deepest truths?",

Those who gain admission to such training classes might duel in formalized settings—and that’s certainly the more genteel route to take. However, others assert that there’s no better training ground for duels than the chaotic life of an adventurer. In such situations, a flexible, single-handed fighting style is invaluable. You never know when you’ll need an extra hand to shove a foe, haul open a door, or grab valuable loot. You can accomplish such deeds with style and grace.

        "description": "Wrestlers are athletes who pit their strength and skill against powerful foes. Specializing in a variety of grabs, holds, and strikes, wrestlers are dangerous opponents whose techniques can leave a foe broken and defeated without taking their life. Though it appears brutal, wrestling is considered a respectable and innocuous art.\n\nThe wrestling tradition is common all over Golarion. Gladiators and other warriors who fight for entertainment use wrestling techniques in combat. The discipline’s focus on grappling is also useful in non-gladiatorial matches, as many foes are unable to contend with an opponent’s hold. Grappling is particularly effective against spellcasters, who have a difficult time completing the gestures for their spells while grabbed. However, with the right technique, a seasoned wrestler can hold down just about any foe standing in their way. Such wrestlers are feared by their foes and respected by their allies.\n\nWrestlers have storied traditions in the Hold of Belkzen, where orcs employ specialized grappling techniques to subdue the large animals they ride as mounts. Orcs prefer wrestling these creatures partially to minimize harm to them, but also because they believe that the process of subduing them in this manner creates a stronger bond between mount and rider.\n\nOutside of the Inner Sea, wrestlers are common in Iblydos and Arcadia. Iblydan wrestlers focus on powerful grappling techniques to make sure they’re never left without a means to fight on the battlefield, even if their weapons are destroyed. Arcadian wrestlers engage in matches designed to retell stories of ancient gods and their past battles. These matches prominently feature impressive acrobatic feats as well as highly technical grappling maneuvers.",

This _spirit dwelling_ might be a treasured family heirloom, an item you crafted expressly to help with exorcisms, or even just an odd trinket you found that happens to do the job.\n\nWhile the motivations of exorcists run the gamut, most are compassionate individuals who believe that every ghost, haunt, and spirit is simply a lost soul in need of rest. They collect spirits expressly for the purposes of offering them comfort, guidance, and absolution. After an exorcist's ministrations, these spirits are freed of their burdens, emotion, and regrets and are reabsorbed into the River of Souls. Although exorcists rarely gather in one place, many different religions employ them to deal with spiritual threats.\n\nExorcists are most commonly found among the faithful of Ashava the True Spark (the empyreal lord of dancers), but among the major deities of the Inner Sea region, Sarenrae, Pharasma, and even Shelyn count a fair number of exorcists among their faithful. Exorcists can come from any walk of life, but many are redeemer champions, clerics, or monks. Apart from the role of the _spirit dwelling_, exorcism practices can vary. For example, a bard or rogue might attract spirits with trickery, charm, or empty promises. In contrast, a cleric of Pharasma could take a more severe route, demanding the spirits return to the natural order of things.",

T'aak spoke of beings known as saumen kar, of a “great whale” sealed beneath the ice, and of strange corruptions. An account left by his wife mentions that T'aak often awoke screaming about “malignant sludge” and a “disease clawing at the ancient gates.” Despite all this, T'aak's primary quest did result in at least one notable accomplishment: the crafting of the first [_gelid shard_](link_item_12041).\n\n[_Gelid shards_](link_item_12041) are [arcane](link_trait_1459) focuses of refined [magical](link_trait_1504) [cold](link_trait_1519) in physical form. Unfortunately for their creator, [_gelid shard_](link_item_12041) do not grant immortality, though mortal creatures bonded to them do often have slightly longer lifespans thanks to the preserving cold that inundates and surrounds them.",

The moment you become a ghoul, your existence focuses upon satisfying this endless craving.

You keep your personality only to have it warped by the never-ending need to consume flesh. A brave warrior remains brave, but under the curse of the fever, that brave warrior's prime directive is to consume flesh. A rogue might go from finding clever ways to pick pockets to finding ways to waylay opponents and devour them.\n\nSince most societies don't allow cannibalism, ghouls who wish to continue their old lives must satisfy their cravings in secret, finding a way to balance society's rules while feeding the constant gnawing hunger inside them. Some take up professions that allow them to secretly eat dead flesh or create dead bodies to feed upon. There are tales told of ghoul mercenary troops who satisfy their cravings and profit, while ghoul spellcasters can use their magic to procure and preserve flesh.\n\nGhouls who won't restrain themselves with rules of the living may join or establish ghoul societies. These caste systems base their hierarchy on how much flesh one has consumed and can provide for other ghouls.

Many tap into these powers with no consideration of the morality of their use. For these unscrupulous magic users, it's simply another avenue in their never-ending pursuit of power, and the abilities learned are turned to the caster's personal ends, whatever they may be.\n\nOthers choose a different path. Through spiritual study and introspection, they have come to recognize the evil intrinsic in the existence of [undead](link_trait_2425), the fundamental wrongness of using the universal energy of death to create an appearance of life. To combat this evil, these casters learn to conduct [vitality](link_trait_1478) energy and direct it to great effect against the [undead](link_trait_2425) they encounter. They may also engage in ongoing study to learn of the nature of life, death, and undeath, and the precise relationship between each state. These scholars and mages are commonly known as hallowed necromancers—a slightly misrepresentative name, as many of them don't use religious methods, but a frequently used shorthand regardless.\n\nThe exact origin of hallowed necromancers' abilities may vary from one to the next. Some are granted their gifts directly by a sympathetic deity such as Sarenrae or Pharasma, while others might use their knowledge of religion and the planes to learn such abilities on their own. Though rarer, it's even possible these practitioners might discover they possess an intuitive understanding and control over abilities that manifest spontaneously as their capabilities grow. Despite this variance, all share a fundamental understanding that undeath is an aberration to be quickly remedied.\n\nThough the majority of hallowed necromancers have similar goals and are willing to work together, they tend not to form their own organizations. More often, these necromancers attach themselves to existing groups—such as the Knights of Lastwall or Voices of the Spire—and use their powers in support of those groups' causes. Otherwise, they plan and carry out their own personal vendettas against the forces of undeath, often enlisting the help of trusted friends and allies.",

The process usually takes weeks, beginning with forced starvation, followed by the consumption of spices and tonics that desiccate the subject's internal organs.\n\nVery rarely, mummies are created by natural processes occurring in locations that are cursed or inundated by [void](link_trait_1485) energy. These mummies most often rise in deserts, bogs, swamps, at high altitudes, or in frigid locales. Although the process through which they are created is less painful and far shorter in duration, the spiritual shift from living to undead is no less traumatizing.\n\nMummies are most commonly found in Geb and Osirion, as well as the surrounding nations of Thuvia, Katapesh, and Qadira. They have a foothold in the Gravelands, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, and the Mwangi Expanse, particularly around Mzali. Outside the Inner Sea, mummies are found in Vudra and Arcadia, particularly in places once ruled by the Razatlani empire.",

Over time, this pact slowly changes the initiate internally and, sometimes, externally as well. The initiate's mind slowly fills with ancient pieces of lore and techniques that are as much part of the saumen kar as their hands and feet. As the initiate's mind adapts to this knowledge and power, their body sometimes evolves in kind—sprouting sweeping horns, gaining heightened olfactory senses, and growing additional height and muscle—becoming a hybrid between their old ancestry and saumen kar, wrapped in runic tattoos.\n\nAn unwilling creature can never be forced to become a pactbound initiate, and only those with deep bonds of mutual friendship with a saumen kar can even attempt the process. Befriending a saumen kar can be enough to begin one's initiation into the pact, though they must choose to accept the burden and can change their minds about undertaking the pact at any point until their final transition (represented by the Bound in Ice feat). Once a creature has completed the pact by accepting the full burden of a saumen kar and taking the Bound in Ice feat, all transformations are permanent. At that point, they can't retrain the Pactbound Dedication, Frostbite Runes, or Bound in Ice feats and must live out the rest of their lives as something between their old ancestry and a saumen kar.

Though tales of Isthralei himself are scarce, his gifts are still sometimes given to those who protect travelers and collect their stories.\n\nThis tradition of chronicling, relearned from the ghost of a Sarkorian storyteller, has flourished at the Academy of the Reclamation. Many students who enter the Sarkoris Scar now travel under Isthralei’s name, both believing in the god’s purpose and using his rediscovery as a symbol of the Reclamation’s successes. Even that may be too small a scope, however, as travelers’ tales come from far and wide. Many campfire chroniclers collect stories of other students who have returned to Sarkoris from afar, along with the stories of their families who were scattered following the opening of the Worldwound.\n\nThe mysterious benefactor accepts all stories with a listening ear, leading to many late night discussions among students about what truths might be hidden in tall tales and outright fabrications. Although Isthralei accepts falsehoods without comment, he places no requirement on the chroniclers to do the same. In fact, Isthralei has yet to provide guidance beyond the comforting warmth of his protection after stories are offered.\n\nAlthough Sarkorian traditions don’t place importance on dividing their gods by power level or origin, some at the Academy of the Reclamation have begun to dig deeper into each of the gods’ individual circumstances. The question of where Isthralei came from has become a particularly popular one among students who hope that a god who so loves the stories of travelers wouldn’t take offense at his own story being exposed.\n\nStudents prying into these matters have found some success using magical sources of information. Most recently, Cobyslarni’s Echo Repository has revealed several tales of travelers and explorers who encountered a smiling figure far from any habitation. The reoccurring theme of weary travelers being offered a space next to the campfire in exchange for their tales has led several students to suggest that the wanderer is actually Isthralei. Unfortunately, the sightings are so vastly spread—occurring between continents, in the First World of the fey, or even on elemental planes—that they’ve provided little illumination of the god’s origins.\n\nAt the academy, Isthralei’s philosophy has expanded to include tenets to protect travelers’ freedom of movement, be generous to others when possible, and seek wisdom in the experience of others. Although these aren’t strictly necessary to gain or keep Isthralei’s favor, it’s difficult to find a teacher among the Academy of the Reclamation without agreeing to these tenets.\n\nThis philosophy of protecting travelers is generally seen to include the Convocation’s guests in Nerosyan. Isthralei’s campfire chroniclers are among the most obvious representatives of their academy and the Convocation as a whole. Although surviving tales of the old god inspire campfire conversations on the exhibit grounds, his followers also listen to stories in bars, cafes, and the schools’ lodgings.",

When the city was attacked by raiders, Hume conjured a guardian from the lake to drive back the attackers. In the process, he also become the region's first god caller in generations.\n\nHume's summoned savior was an ancient spirit guide from the Plane of Water named Dyzad. With Dyzad's guidance, Domorans summoned more such spirit guides, all of which the citizens worshipped as gods long after his passing. This tradition of god calling—and the worship of Sarkorian gods—came to define the city of Domora.\n\nIn the ensuing years, countless pilgrims, Sarkorian or otherwise, came to Domora to learn of god calling. Many hoped to summon a god to bring back to their own people, while others petitioned the deities as a means of spiritual growth. Today, the Domoran god calling tradition is all but extinguished—wiped out during the Worldwound incursion. Nonetheless, worthy individuals who brave Domora's ruins might unbury a small fragment of this tradition. Although they aren't true god callers—they lack the ability to bond with greater spirit guides or unlock the highest levels of their power—such “scions” still forge unique relationships with lesser spirit guides. Scions of Domora provide physical and spiritual anchors for their spirit guide companions, while the spirit guide returns the favor by sharing a portion of its supernatural powers.",

Some see this watchful and outwardly friendly nature as condescending, but they don't understand the reason why worshipers of Findeladlara feel a duty to uphold this tradition. When Earthfall struck and most of the other elves on Golarion fled to Sovyrian or delved deep into the earth, the elves that would one day come to be known as Ilverani remained and sought to shelter others from catastrophe. They built refuges to protect others and helped guide people to safety during the Age of Darkness. While Twilight Seekers today don't build safe structures, they do work to build bonds among people so that society can be protected against other catastrophic events should they come to pass.\n\nThis calling brings you in contact with many different cultures, yet you seek to preserve the ways of your people. To this end, you are ever on your guard against the lure of “modern fads.” Unfortunately, some twilight speakers have succumbed to the allure of other ways of life and, for them, there is only one outcome: exile.",

        "description": "According to folklore, the thlipit martial art began with a wager. A group of bored tripkees looking for a little sport devised a game of using their tongues to gather fruit out of nearby trees. As the competition wore on and the bets escalated, the contestants began snatching falling fruit in midair and even using their tongues to push away the competition. While the names of the original competitors vary between tellings, all agree that the contest ended with a particularly magnificent tongue flick, landing an overripe mango squarely upon a losing bettor’s head.\n\nNo matter the origin, variants of the game and the martial art it spawned have become mainstays in tripkee society. In contrast to other fighting styles, thlipit doesn’t stand on ceremony or rigid discipline. Practitioners refer to themselves as contestants and play off the forms and moves as mere exercises or games. Despite this veneer of frivolity, thlipit can be just as dangerous in the mouth of an adept as any other weapon.\n\nThlipit combines fluid movements reminiscent of whip fighting with the leverage of a wrestler’s stance. It favors quick smacks, brief grabs, and short throws. Friend, foe, and the contestant themselves always remain in motion. Moves are often exaggerated to play up stylish elements for spectators or lure brash opponents into attacking early.\n\nNo formal schools exist to teach thlipit. Many tripkees are familiar with the style from childhood games, even if they haven’t developed the physicality to be considered a true contestant. Self-directed instruction remains common, though aspiring contestants will seek out veterans and ask to be taken on as apprentices. Even though this sort of self-directed instruction happens frequently, a veteran contestant will still occasionally take on a student or two to pass along particular forms or styles.\n\nThough thlipit originated with tripkees, tripkee migration to Vidrian and other population centers has exposed other peoples to the sport. Most notably, thlipit has become popular with the recent generation of iruxi youth, who have adapted it for use with a tail rather than a tongue. Though not every move is possible with a tail, they have added their own innovations to the style.",

As a sentinel, you might be part of an order of knights or bodyguards who trained you how best to take advantage of heavy armor.

Some witches or sorcerers have chosen to follow the path of the sentinel to increase their survivability. While this is less common, it’s not less effective. Few will argue against stronger, heavier armor leading to a longer life, and as every turtle knows, it’s always nice to have a nice hard shell to fall back on when threatened. No one has a tougher shell than a sentinel. Even in the midst of great battles, you know that your armor is your greatest ally. It won’t abandon you, break, or falter as things get tough. You can rely on your armor to see you through whatever tough fights lie ahead, and the odds always seem better when you’re protected.",

Such items might even be used to house additional insects if their swarm grows too big to fit inside their body.\n\nSwarmkeepers can add new capabilities to their swarms.

More unorthodox cultivators instead mingle qi with the Void and the Netherworld’s dark energies.\n\nWhile humanoid cultivators are the norm, it isn’t unheard of for animals, trees, rocks, or even household objects to cultivate their qi and become powerful yaoguai (page 82). The mountains of Shanguang, Shenmen, and Zi Ha are famed sites for cultivators, as are the bamboo groves of Songbai and the verdant heart of the Valashmai Jungle. All types of cultivators are watched over carefully by Tian Xia’s imperial dragons, for cultivators go against Heaven’s will in seeking to transcend their ontology and destiny. There is little place for the timid among cultivators, as they seek to stand among the most powerful beings of both earth and Heaven. As a result, their personalities tend to be extreme, possessed of otherworldly benevolence, hellish wrath, or unmoving poise.\n\nThe intense effort and discipline required to reach the peaks of cultivation weed out most aspirants before they can even truly begin, and the tribulations that most cultivators attract winnows the rest. While calamity drives many to cultivate, rumors persist that gods and dragons alike test and punish cultivation’s path with yet more hardship and woe. For every cultivator who eventually attains immortality, a thousand more aspirants meet their ends in the cruelest fates.\n\nCultivators are rare, even within Tian Xia.",

When a grave threat arises, a zodiac constellation might shine on an everyday student or worker, granting them the power to transform into a powerful alter ego to repel those threats. Though most of these starlit sentinels act covertly when the world is asleep, some become well known either as urban legends or outright celebrities, though usually only as their alter ego. Some might find themselves pulled between the dual pressures of an unassuming civilian identity working in a market by day, and the defender of that same market from rampaging oni or qi-stealing jiang-shi under the light of the stars. Due to a quartet of well-known female sentinels operating out of Goka, many have come to believe that the zodiac chooses only girls as its champions, but the heavens care little for such mortal concerns and are equally likely to grant their power to those of any gender. Starlit sentinels are rare, even in Tian Xia, and individual sentinels are unique; a new sentinel empowered by a given constellation won’t awaken as long as the previous sentinel of that constellation is active.",

The imbuing of raw magic into the point of an arrow is no easy feat. Eldritch archers are respected and feared for their prowess and make valuable members for any party of adventurers.\n\nWhile having some spellcasting ability increases your flexibility and power as an eldritch archer, you might learn the secrets of these arts without being independently skilled in spellcasting, instead learning the magic of the bow for its own sake. In fact, many eldritch archers begin as archers first and spellcasters second. That is not to say that the occasional spellcaster has not picked up archery. In fact, many wizards, wise in the art of war, have studied the bow, particularly to master this art.

They come from a tradition of ancient secrets and principles, which they temper with modern innovation and perspective. Spellshots combine magical power into the art of gunplay to create a distinct and mystical way known only to spellshots, enigmatic and unavailable to other gunslingers in the world at large. The first to identify themselves as spellshots tied their magical traditions to the history of the Star Code and the Crowned Regents in Arcadia. Ancient, reclusive crafters known as the Crowned Regents created star guns, the legendary magical firearms that shot white-hot blasts of energy. Wielders of star guns became bound together by the Star Code—a set of cultural expectations that defined how one should behave while using these powerful weapons.\n\nMost spellshots continue to come from Arcadia, as the stories describing the relevant skills and training to become one have been passed down over the generations. Many gunslingers who grow up in this region hear of these tales early in their lives, and they develop the techniques to channel magical energy through their firearms in imitation of the Regents' arcane methods. While Arcadia is home to the vast majority of the world's spellshots, the techniques have slowly spread to other regions.

        "description": "Battle harbingers are elite, specially trained members of their faith, usually carrying out missions that require extra martial prowess. Built for the battlefield and used to working alongside other warriors, as well as tackling dangerous solo operations, battle harbingers typically spend more time training outside their temples than praying within them. What they lack in spellcasting prowess they make up for with expertise in weaponry and defense.\n\nEven less combat-oriented faiths understand that battle harbingers can be a necessity, especially if there’s a dangerous quest that must be undertaken alone. Because battle harbingers rigorously train their bodies to withstand hardship, they tend to have more capability to support themselves, leaving more traditional priests to handle group-wide supportive magic and prayers.\n\nBattle harbingers specialize in bolstering themselves with their deity’s power and weakening their opponents in the same vein.\n\nA battle harbinger’s training varies greatly from that of a typical cleric. While this training initially resembles that of a warpriest cleric, the martial and spellcasting philosophies of a battle harbinger soon differ. A battle harbinger is taught to rely less on their spells, instead focusing on a select array of spells to supplement their combat abilities. Their main magical abilities focus on battle auras, spells that create areas centered on the battle harbinger that either empower their allies or hamper their foes. Battle harbingers are generally expected to take the fight directly to a foe, and their auras supplement these tactics.\n\nThe main component of a battle harbinger’s training involves their battle creed. While a battle creed varies from faith to faith, the core aspects of these creeds remain the same regardless of dogma. A battle creed declares a battle harbinger to be a living weapon for their god or faith. The battle harbinger is expected to enter combat on behalf of their god and to adhere to strict training regimens that support this goal. Battle harbingers train to make use of powerful armor and their god’s favored weapon. Supplemental training focuses on the body, allowing battle harbingers to stave off fatigue and dangers that target one’s health directly. Some battle harbingers, such as those who follow Erastil, prefer to make use of ranged tactics, but they still learn more direct combat should the need arise.\n\nAlthough a battle harbinger’s spellcasting capabilities are more limited than their fellow clerics, their magic generally isn’t less potent. Battle harbingers are still capable of calling down strong divine power, but they rely on this magic less often than their brethren. This is mostly due to their martial training, which focuses on their bodies, combat, and defense. As such, a battle harbinger doesn’t carry as much magic potential as other clerics. The exception to this is their training in battle auras, which many battle harbingers are able to make greater use of as their prowess grows.\n\nWhile most battle harbingers are associated with a given temple, it’s not unusual for one to be a lone mercenary, enacting their deity’s will along their travels and through their contract work.",

But be warned: You might succumb to sin in your pursuit of power. The seven runes held in highest regard by the runelords echo the addictive power of the seven sins.\n\nBeyond the runes themselves, you also learn the techniques of the ancient runelords. You learn to use their signature weapons and can acquire the secrets of the ancient magic items called _aeon stones_, embedding them into your skin.\n\n### Runelord (1st)\n\nYou draw untold power from runes, sometimes called sin magic. You associate with one of the seven sins, also known as the seven rewards of rule: envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. If you choose this class archetype, you must select [Runelord Dedication](link_feat_40928) as your 2nd-level class feat.\n\n**Prerequisites:** You must be a wizard.\n\n**Runelord Adjustments:** You become trained in martial polearms and spears. When your proficiency for simple weapons increases, your proficiencies in these weapons increases as well. You learn the Thassilonian language.\n\nInstead of an arcane thesis, you gain a personal rune. Your personal rune also affects your arcane bond.\n\nYou must select the School of Thassilonian Rune Magic as your arcane school, and you must choose one sin to specialize in. When you cast any curriculum spell or school spell from the School of Thassilonian Rune Magic, you do so simply by tracing runes of power in the air. This removes the need to speak incantations aloud. When you [Refocus](link_action_19754), you do so by contemplating or indulging in your sin.\n\nEach sin is opposed by two others. The incompatibility of these sins means that casting magic philosophically appropriate to those opposing sins, as represented by each school’s anathema, interrupts your connection to your own sin and personal rune. If you violate your sin’s anathema, you lose the benefits of your personal rune, and whenever you attempt to cast a curriculum spell or school spell, you must succeed at a DC 15 flat check or the spell is lost. This disruption lasts until you complete an [atone](link_spell_4405) ritual; unlike a normal [atone](link_spell_4405) ritual, Arcana can be used for both the primary and secondary checks. Your curriculum spells (including spells of your own sin) never violate this anathema, sometimes providing alternatives to prohibited magic. You gain [Advanced School Spell](link_feat_19884) as a bonus feat at 8th level, gaining the advanced school spell for the School of Thassilonian Rune Magic; once you’ve begun your studies of sin magic, there is no turning back from its allure.",

These thespians are capable of mimicking Taldor’s vast array of stage-immortalized luminaries via vivid impressions, awe-inspiring vocal performances, and wild stunts that defy all expectations. The Academy’s foremost instructors and senior Lion Blades agents keep a close eye on all prodigies who show a sliver of this potential, helping them harness their talents for use in both the acting world and the world of spycraft.\n\nThrough Taldor’s long history, a handful of classic roles have been repeated and hammered into shape until they became icons and metaphors that define the art of Taldor. Although some of these are symbols of national strength, like First Emperor Taldaris, many are tragic or even comedic figures like Emperor Beldam I. Accepting any one of these roles in a high-profile production can be the highlight of an actor’s career, but the best of the best gather these roles like trophies.\n\nNewer roles are added to the canon very slowly, with modern figures like Grand Princess Eutropia usually alluded to with references from other roles. Many performances with Cyricas and his animal friends now feature a dog at his side, for example, as a reference to the grand princess’s beloved pet.\n\nAlthough the most famous internationally, Kitharodian Academy is not the sole repository of Taldor’s stories. Many other schools in Taldor, like the nearby Rhapsodic College, teach the classics. But these plays and songs are such a deeply rooted part of Taldor’s culture that prodigies arise from the soldiers of Zimar to the dwarven enclaves in Maheto.",

While many inventors innovate new tools or seek fortune or fame, the munitions master seeks an edge in battle, one that might mean the difference between victory and defeat for their side. They aim to bring the sheer destructive power of siege weapons to a more compact and personal scale so that they can be deployed anywhere they are needed.\n\nThe portable light mortar used by munitions masters first appeared in Dongun Hold, a collaboration between Dongun siege weapon operators and Alkenstar inventors.",

Together, you practice moving, fighting, and even speaking in complete harmony so that your souls may unite into one, a single spirit in two bodies.

You and your student share a deep connection, the nature of which is up to the two of you. As a symbol of your bond, you might each wear small, identical chains somewhere on your body.

These spirits might choose a form that strikes their fancy or inhabit one that best reflects their personality, temperament, or philosophy. Sometimes, an apparition achieves a greater awareness that results in a spiritual awakening. Such entities might develop a strong magical connection to the world that elevates and separates them from others of their kind. Over time, they might form connections or mystical bonds with worthy individuals to serve throughout their chosen partner's lifetime, possibly continuing on to watch over their partner's descendants and becoming spiritual household guardians. Typically, these apparitions are remnants of humanoid souls or personifications of spiritually infused items or locations, but in some cases, primal spirits form similar bonds, granting a greater connection to the five elements and the natural world. Regardless of the fundamental nature of these spirits, those who have mastered the ability to conjure and control a familiar can form a bond with them that unlocks a unique and potent well of shared magical energy.",
