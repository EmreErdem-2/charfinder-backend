        "name": "Focus",
        "description": "A spell you can cast by spending a Focus Point, and that is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up.\n\n* * *\n\nFocus spells are a special type of spell attained directly from a branch of study, from a deity, or from another specific source. You can learn focus spells only through special class features or feats, rather than choosing them from a spell list. Furthermore, you cast focus spells using a special pool of Focus Points—you can't prepare a focus spell in a spell slot or use your spell slots to cast focus spells; similarly, you can't spend your Focus Points to cast spells that aren't focus spells. Even some classes that don't normally grant spellcasting can grant focus spells, such as the [ranger](link_class_24). The title of a focus spell's stat block says “Focus” instead of “Spell”, and the spell has the focus trait.\n\nFocus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, just like cantrips are. You can't cast a focus spell if its minimum rank is greater than half your level rounded up, even if you somehow gain access to it.\n\nCasting any of your focus spells costs you 1 Focus Point. You automatically gain a focus pool the first time you gain an ability that gives you a focus spell. The maximum number of points in your pool is equal to the number of focus spells you know or 3, whichever is lower. This counts only spells that require Focus Points to cast. For example, a [bard](link_class_21)'s [composition](link_trait_1895) cantrips don't count toward the size of the pool.\n\nYou replenish all the Focus Points in your pool during your daily preparations. You can also use the [Refocus](link_action_19754) activity to pray, study, meditate, or otherwise reattune yourself to the source of your focus magic and regain 1 Focus Point. You can [Refocus](link_action_19754) multiple times to regain multiple points, up to your pool's maximum.\n\n#### Spellcasters with Focus Spells\n\nIf you are a spellcaster, your focus spells are the same tradition of spell as the class that gave you the focus spell. A [bard](link_class_21)’s are [occult](link_trait_1514), a [cleric](link_class_22)’s are [divine](link_trait_1475), a [druid](link_class_23)’s are [primal](link_trait_1454), a [wizard](link_class_26)’s are [arcane](link_trait_1459), and a [witch](link_class_27)’s are determined by their [patron](link_class-feature_21164).\n\n#### Non-Spellcasters with Focus Spells\n\nIf you get focus spells from a class or other source that doesn’t grant spellcasting ability, the ability that gives you focus spells also provides your proficiency for your spell attack modifier and spell DC, as well as the magical tradition of your focus spells. Though you can cast your focus spells, you don’t qualify for feats and other rules that require you to be a spellcaster or have a spellcasting class feature—those require you to have spell slots.\n\n#### Focus Points from Multiple Sources\n\nIt’s possible, especially through [archetypes](link_trait_1439), to gain focus spells from more than one source. If this happens, you have just one focus pool, counting all your focus spells to determine the points in your pool. You can spend any of your Focus Points on any of your focus spells. Likewise, when you [Refocus](link_action_19754), you get back a point as long as you follow the guidelines of any abilities that granted you focus spells. Having Focus Points from multiple sources doesn’t change the tradition of your spells; if you had both [cleric](link_class_22) domain spells and [druid](link_class_23) order spells, your domain spells would remain [divine](link_trait_1475) and the order spells [primal](link_trait_1454). Similarly, you need to use the attribute modifier determined by the source of the focus spell.",

        "description": "Most habitable planets have gravity similar to what you experience on Earth or the world of Lost Golarion, defined as normal gravity. Other environments have higher or lower gravity, potentially debilitating characters or empowering them like superheroes.\n\n### **Extreme Gravity**\n\nAn environment with extreme gravity is dangerous for most characters. In addition to the effects of high gravity (see below), a character takes minor to moderate bludgeoning damage per minute.\n\n### **High Gravity**\n\nAn environment with high gravity will be oppressive for most creatures. A character (and their gear) weighs twice as much as in a normal gravity environment, but their attributes stay the same. Such characters move at half speed (minimum 5 feet), can jump only half as high or as far, and can carry and lift only half as much. High gravity also reduces the ranges of thrown weapons by half. Fatigue High gravity reduces the time it takes for characters to become fatigued from overland travel to only 2 hours. Characters who spend more than a day in a high gravity\n\n### **Normal Gravity**\n\nAn environment with normal gravity has conditions similar to planets like Earth or lost Golarion and has no effect on most characters.\n\n### **Low Gravity**\n\nAn environment with low gravity is liberating for creatures accustomed to normal or higher gravity. A character can jump twice as high and as far, can lift or carry twice their normal amount, and doubles the range of thrown weapons.\n\n### **Zero Gravity**\n\nEnvironments such as outer space and some small satellites have zero gravity (also referred to as zero-g). Creatures in zero-g have the clumsy, off-guard, and untethered conditions. A creature in a zero gravity environment can lift and carry 10 times their normal amount and multiplies the ranges of thrown weapons by 10.\n\n#### **Movement in Zero Gravity**\n\nCreatures in a zero-g environment float aimlessly without a method of propulsion or holding on to an object. Creatures that fly via methods that require an atmosphere, such as wings, can’t use their fly Speeds in zero-g. Creatures flying with some other method of propulsion, such as jetpacks, starship thrusters, and spells like fly or void vessel, are unaffected. Creatures with a fly Speed and the cosmic trait are also unaffected. Unless a creature has a means of moving in zero-g, it gains the untethered condition.",

You can activate magic tea with an [Interact](link_action_19733) action as you drink it or feed it to another creature, as if it were a potion. You can also activate magic tea with a 10-minute activity that requires [sterling tea ware](link_item_6724) (these artisan’s tools can be shared by up to four people who take this activity simultaneously) to prepare the tea and then consume it or present it to someone during a short tea ceremony, after which the magic tea’s effects begin; activating magic tea in this way enhances its effect, as detailed in the entry’s **Tea Ceremony**\n\nOnce you drink a dose of magic tea, you’re temporarily immune to that particular type of magic tea for 24 hours",

        "name": "Staff",
        "description": "This [magical](link_trait_1504) staff holds spells of a particular theme and allows a spellcaster to cast additional spells by preparing it. A staff gains charges when someone prepares it for the day, adding a number of charges to the staff equal to the highest rank of spell they're able to cast. Depending on whether they're a prepared or spontanous spellcaster, they gain an additional way to add charges to the staff. The person who prepared a staff can expend the charges to cast spells from it.\n\nYou can [Cast a Spell](link_action_19611) from a staff only if you have that spell on your spell list, are able to cast spells of the appropriate rank, and expend a number of charges from the staff equal to the spell’s rank ([cantrips](link_trait_1858) do not require charges to be expended). Use your spell attack roll and spell DC when [Casting a Spell](link_action_19611) from a staff. The spell gains the appropriate trait for your magical tradition ([arcane](link_trait_1459), [divine](link_trait_1475), [occult](link_trait_1514), or [primal](link_trait_1454)) and can be affected by any modifications you can normally make when casting spells, such as [spellshape](link_trait_1465) feats. You must provide any material components, cost, or focus required by the spell, or you fail to cast it.\n\n### Preparing a Staff\n\nDuring your daily preparations, you can prepare a staff to add charges to it for free. When you do so, that staff gains a number of charges equal to the rank of your highest spell slot. You don’t need to expend any spells to add charges in this way. No one can prepare more than one staff per day, nor can a staff be prepared by more than one person per day. If the charges aren’t used within 24 hours, they’re lost, and preparing the staff anew removes any charges previously stored in it. You can prepare a staff only if you have at least one of the staff’s spells on your spell list.\n\n#### Prepared Spellcasters\n\nA prepared spellcaster—such as a cleric, druid, witch, or wizard—can place some of their own magic in a staff to increase its number of charges. When a prepared spellcaster prepares a staff, they can expend a spell slot to add a number of charges equal to the rank of the spell. They can’t expend more than one spell in this way each day. For example, if a wizard can cast 3rd-rank spells and prepared a staff, the staff would gain 3 charges, but wizard could increase this to 6 by expending one of their 3rd-rank spells, 5 by expending a 2nd-rank spell, or 4 by expending a 1st-rank spell.\n\n#### Spontaneous Spellcasters\n\nA spontaneous spellcaster—such as a bard, oracle, or sorcerer—can reduce the number of charges it takes to Activate a staff by supplementing it with their own energy. When a spontaneous spellcaster Activates a staff, they can expend 1 charge from the staff and one of their spell slots to cast a spell from the staff of the same rank (or lower) as the expended spell slot. This doesn’t change the number of actions it takes to cast the spell. For example, if a sorcerer can cast 3rd-rank spells and prepared a staff, the staff would gain 3 charges. They could expend 1 charge and one of their 3rd-rank spell slots to cast a 3rd-rank spell from the staff, or 1 charge and one of their 2nd-rank spell slots to cast a 2nd-rank spell from the staff. They could still expend 3 charges from the staff to cast a 3rd-rank spell from it without using any of their own slots, just like any other spellcaster.\n\n### Attacking with a Staff\n\nStaves are also [staff](link_item_7853) weapons. They can be etched with fundamental runes but not property runes.",

        "description": "Combination weapons combine the functionality of melee weapons and ranged weapons in unique or unusual ways. A combination weapon has a ranged form or usage and a melee weapon form or usage. The combination weapons table lists the ranged weapon statistics first and the melee weapon statistics indented beneath, just above the ammunition. Switching between the melee weapon usage and the ranged weapon usage requires an [Interact](link_action_19733) action. However, if your last action was a successful melee [Strike](link_action_19856) against a foe using a combination weapon, you can make a ranged [Strike](link_action_19856) with the combination weapon against that foe without fully switching to the ranged weapon usage, firing the ranged weapon just as you hit with the melee attack. In this case, the combination weapon returns to its melee usage after the ranged weapon [Strike](link_action_19856).\n\nSince a combination weapon is one weapon with two usages, both usages share any fundamental runes. You can put a property rune on a combination weapon as long as it's appropriate for either of the two usages, but if only one of the usages meets the property rune's requirements, the effects of the property rune only apply for that usage. For instance, a [vorpal](link_item_7921) axe musket only applies the [vorpal](link_item_7921) property rune when you're using it as an axe. Due to their complexity, combination weapons can't have another weapon, such as a [bayonet](link_item_13706) or [reinforced stock](link_item_13707), attached to them.",

        "name": "Relic",
        "description": "Some extraordinary magic items grow in power along with a character, gaining abilities that add to an adventurer's legend. These are called relics, and owning one can define a character more than any other magic item.\n\nRelics begin as a simple item, called a relic seed, which is little more than a functional item with a minor magical effect associated with it. As the owner of the relic grows in power, so does the relic. It develops gifts, which are new magical abilities and activations. These abilities might be themed to the relic, the character, or the nature of the campaign. If a relic is passed to another character, this process begins anew, sometimes granting the same abilities again over time, but possibly unlocking entirely new powers. If someone else takes the relic from its owner, it usually works for a while, though it might lose its power incrementally over time if not returned to its owner. How the relic changes in such a circumstance is up to you and should fit the story.\n\nThe decision to add relics to the game is entirely up to you as the GM. If you decide to add them, you'll need to adjust treasure somewhat. It's also wise to consider how many players you expect to end up with relics. Will they each get one? Or will there be just one or two tied to the theme of the campaign?\n\nDiscovering a Relic\n-------------------\n\nSome relics might begin as ordinary items with a rich history. They might be part of a character's starting gear, only to have their true powers uncovered later during play. Other relics can be acquired during play as part of the ongoing story. Regardless of their origin, these powerful items might not appear to be much at first, but they contain the potential to become something truly great.\n\nFor example, an old, tarnished amulet found around the neck of a buried king might turn out to be an item of deep historical significance that awakens to great power. The seemingly ordinary family sword, passed down to each new generation, might unlock hidden potential through the deeds of its owner.\n\nThe PCs might immediately recognize a relic for its ability, or they might carry it for a time before its true nature becomes apparent. The story of a relic should be a tale of discovery. At first, a relic's wielder likely doesn't fully understand the item's power, or might be unable to use it, learning of its abilities only after a momentous event or fortuitous breakthrough. Ultimately, relics are powerful tools in service of the story, working as a valuable tie to the narrative, but their growth and development are in your hands. Because of the place relics hold in the story, they aren't available for purchase, nor can they be crafted.\n\nPay attention to the characters' backstories for potential relics, and look for spots in your narrative that might be suitable for campaign relics. If you're planning to use relics in your game, let the players know in advance, since their ideas and plans can guide you and give them greater investment in the relics.\n\n### Background Relics\n\nA background relic is tied to the history of a character, and its form and abilities should draw inspiration from the story of their character’s life or the past of the item. The relic could be a gift from a friend or mentor, an heirloom from the character’s family, a found object from their upbringing, or even the first item they ever crafted. The player should select the form of the relic (a battered longsword, a copper ring, or a threadbare red cloak, for example).\n\n### Campaign Relics\n\nA campaign relic is drawn from the ongoing story of the campaign. You decide the entirety of the item, from its form to its aspects (described below) as part of the story of the campaign. Use campaign relics to reinforce and foreshadow the themes of your game. Relics come to those who need them to do great deeds, after all, so finding a relic with the perfect aspects for your future challenges is entirely likely. Unlike background relics, campaign relics typically have magical abilities when first found.\n\n#### Relic Aspects\n\nEach relic is associated with aspects—typically two—that speak to its overall concept and purpose. The individual gifts each have an associated aspect. You should almost always select gifts that have an aspect matching one of those found on the relic. For example, a brass dagger recovered from the Medina Mudii'a might have the [fire](link_trait_3491) and [mind](link_trait_3497) aspects, which means that it could have the [flare bolt](link_feat_29523) gift (which has the [fire aspect](link_trait_3491)), but not the [rolling geode](link_feat_29506) gift (which has the [earth aspect](link_trait_3488)).\n\nUsually, you can determine at least one aspect of a relic easily by looking at the history of the item or personality of the character. For example, if a player decides that their background relic is a rusty mace wielded by the character's great grandmother in battle against rising undead hordes, the mace might have the [life aspect](link_trait_3494), as it was used to slay countless undead creatures. There's no harm in letting the player choose an aspect for a background relic; through play, the item will reveal another aspect associated with it. In the previous example, the mace might reveal itself to have powers against demons as well, in which case its aspects might be celestial and life.\n\n**Advancing a Relic**\n\nAs a relic's bearer performs mighty deeds and advances their story, the relic gets stronger. The most basic advancement for a relic is its level, which always matches that of its owner. Weapons and armor can gain fundamental runes normally. You decide what, if any, property runes can be added to a given relic; by default, they can't have property runes, like any other specific item.\n\nThe more complex advancement comes from gifts. The Relic Gifts table shows the typical number of gifts a relic should have at a given level, but relics don't follow this strictly. Rather, gifts arise according to the pace of the story, the needs of the campaign, and the relationship between the character and the relic. Generally speaking, this results in a relic gaining one gift for every 4 levels its bearer has, but this might fluctuate as the campaign progresses. For example, a relic might gain its first gift at 4th level after the bearer defeats a powerful foe. It might then gain its second at 7th, after they perform a special ritual. That same relic might not gain another gift until 13th level and then again at 16th as the player reaches other major milestones.\n\nThe gift types—[minor](link_trait_3479), [major](link_trait_3480), and [grand](link_trait_3481)—indicate their general power level. Again, the table indicates what's generally appropriate at certain levels, but you can alter them as you see fit. You should usually avoid giving a [minor gift](link_trait_3479) at 10th level or higher, because it just won't be that impressive, though some of them scale well enough to be interesting at higher levels. The Gold Piece Equivalent entry for each gift helps you determine how much you should reduce treasure when using relics (see Adjusting Treasure below).\n\n**Table 2–22: Relic Gifts**\n\n| Number of Gifts | Minimum Level | Gift Type | Gold Piece Equivalent |\n\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n| 1 | 1st | Minor | 20 gp |\n\n| 2 | 5th | Minor | 160 gp |\n\n| 3 | 9th | Major | 700 gp |\n\n| 4 | 13th | Major | 3,000 gp |\n\n| 5 | 17th | Grand | 15,000 gp |\n\nYou decide what gifts a relic gains, generally by either selecting a single gift or offering two paths for the relic to grow and allowing the player to choose, but this should be informed by the story and the nature of the character bearing the relic. A relic should complement the bearer, bolstering the bearer's strengths and helping to overcome their weaknesses. Within that framework, you should try to maintain a cohesive theme for the relic.\n\n**Adjusting Treasure**\n\nWhen you incorporate relics into your game, you can adjust the treasure gained by the party down to account for the relics increasing in power. Essentially, some of the treasure from the Party Treasure by Level table on page 59 should be replaced with relic seeds and gifts instead. You can use the relic's minimum level, replacing a permanent item of that level, or you can use the gp equivalent. Keep in mind that relic gifts are often a little more powerful than other items with the same Price even when they start out, and they often scale without any additional costs, so PCs with relics will usually be a bit more powerful.\n\nIf you prefer, you can grant relics in addition to other rewards. This means PCs will be much more powerful, but you're rewarding their investment in the story.\n\n**Making Relic Seeds**\n\nA relic seed can be quite simple: imagine a standard item with two aspects and an appearance that matches the theme. You can also use an existing magic item for a campaign relic; pick two aspects for it, and tweak its appearance or characteristics to make it clearly different from other items of its type. You can choose a tradition for the seed and apply that trait to the seed and all the gifts of the seed. This tradition might be derived from the background of the item, or it might appear or change through story moments involving the relic.\n\nIf you want a relic to have an additional special benefit, you can design it to grant a bonus to a skill, typically a +1 item bonus for a 3rd-level relic.\n\n**Relic Gifts**\n\nGifts are divided up into three tiers. [Minor gifts](link_trait_3479) grant useful, often scaling abilities and are available early in a character's career. [Major gifts](link_trait_3480) define a relic, determining its true purpose and granting powerful abilities. [Grand gifts](link_trait_3481) are the pinnacle of power, and most relics never have more than one.\n\nThe more gifts there are of one aspect, the more the relic reflects that aspect, and the more influence the aspect has on the character who wields it. An item with multiple [shadow](link_trait_3499) gifts might begin to lose its color. With four or five, the character that wields it might take on an ashen tone and the relic might become entirely made of shadow.\n\n**Gift Saves and Spell Attack Modifiers**\n\nMany gifts allow for a saving throw or have other abilities that change as the relic goes up in level. The DC for any saving throw called for by a gift is the higher of its owner’s class DC or spell DC. The spell attack modifier of a gift is 10 lower than that DC. A relic’s counteract modifier is equal to its owner’s counteract modifier.\n\n> ### Player-Driven Relics\n> \n> Though these rules assume you as the GM are providing relic gifts as a form of treasure with input from the players, you can instead have the players make all the decisions for their relics. Encourage the players to choose different styles of items and aspects to match their characters' themes, rather than simply choosing the most powerful combination of options. Have players describe how their relic gets more powerful in the story. What acts from previous sessions lent the relic power? What special meditations or practices did they perform to unlock new gifts? How does it feel to have the relic grow?\n> \n> As the item and the character level up, the player chooses which gifts the item gets from the list as a part of character advancement. You still adjust treasure as normal for incorporating relics into your game. In fact, if the player tries to optimize the combinations, they will likely be more powerful than under the standard method\n> \n> ### Runes as Gifts\n> \n> You can substitute runes for gifts. If you choose to allow property runes on the relic, you'll want them to take up rune slots. Otherwise, you can give as many or few as you prefer, just like any other gifts. Runes are sorted into [minor](link_trait_3479), [major](link_trait_3480), and [grand](link_trait_3481) categories, but you should use their normal level and Price when you adjust treasure, instead of the number and levels on the Relic Gifts table.

If you choose to use one of them, it replaces the melee usage's normal critical specialization effect.\n\nFirst, if the ranged weapon is a firearm, you can discharge it to create a loud bang and concussion, using the critical specialization effect for firearms instead of the melee weapon group's critical specialization effect. Second, you can choose to discharge the ranged weapon to increase the critical hit's momentum or shoot the foe as you attack in melee, dealing 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Both of these options discharge the ranged weapon, which typically means you have to reload it before firing it again.",

However, if you use both hands, the weapon can make fatal attacks. When you wield the weapon in two hands, it gains the [fatal](link_trait_2759) trait with the listed damage die. Holding the weapon underarm stably enough to fire is significantly more complicated than just releasing one hand from the weapon, so to switch between the two grips, you must do so with an [Interact](link_action_19733) action rather than [Releasing](link_action_19755) or as part of reloading.",

While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history—both for those who transform themselves and for the countless mortals who will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power.",

        "description": "Your [arcane school](link_class-feature_21240) is where you devoted yourself to the study of spellcraft. Whether you learned in the storied halls of a formal institution, via an apprenticeship with an archmage, or taught yourself from secondhand tomes, your arcane school indelibly set the curriculum and direction of your magic.\n\n**Curriculum Spells:** You automatically add some of the spells listed in your school's curriculum to your spellbook. At 1st level, you add a cantrip and two 1st-rank spells of your choice. As soon as you gain the ability to cast wizard spells of a new rank, choose one of the spells from your curriculum of that rank to add to your spellbook. A superscript “U” indicates an uncommon spell. Your GM might allow you to swap or add other spells to your curriculum if they strongly fit the theme.\n\n**Spell Slots:** Each day, you can prepare an extra cantrip from your curriculum. You also gain an extra spell slot at each spell rank for which you have wizard spell slots. You can prepare only spells from your school's curriculum in these extra slots. Any spell listed in your curriculum of a suitable spell rank is eligible to be prepared in each of these extra slots, regardless of how you added the spell to your spellbook.\n\n**School Spells:** School spells are a type of [focus spell](link_trait_1856). It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the [Refocus](link_action_19754) activity to study your spellbook or conduct arcane research. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](link_trait_1856).\n\nYou learn the initial school spell, which is unique to your school. You can learn the advanced school spell with the [Advanced School Spell](link_feat_19884) feat.",

Your patron's true identity might be a powerful hag, a fey lord, a deity or demigod, an archdevil, or a similarly powerful entity, or perhaps multiple such figures working in tandem, but that identity is for you to attempt to discover as you learn more of your patron's lessons. Some patrons are multifaceted, appearing in different guises, and granting different powers to different witches. In some cases, the witch may know of their patron's identity, but have some other aspect shrouded in uncertainty; they might know their patron's name but not motive, or perhaps even if they know the patron's identity, they have been cursed to never reveal it to others.\n\nYour patron determines the following.\n\n**Spell List** You use this magical tradition and spell list;\n\n**Patron Skill** You become trained in the skill associated with your patron's magical tradition.\n\n**Initial Lesson** This is the first lesson your patron teaches you and is unique to your patron.\n\n**Familiar Ability** One of your familiar's two bonus abilities is always the one listed here, a mark of your patron's indelible influence.

It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the [Refocus](link_action_19754) activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.\n\nFocus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points.

On a failure, the innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions. On a critical failure, you also take an amount of fire damage equal to half your level. You can spend 10 minutes retuning your innovation and making adjustments to return it to functionality, at which point you can use unstable actions with that innovation again.\n\nTo take an unstable action, you must be using your innovation (for example, wearing an armor innovation or wielding a weapon innovation). If you have a minion innovation, some unstable actions are taken by the minion instead of you. In these cases, only the minion can take that action, and the minion needs to have been Commanded that turn to take the action. If you critically fail the flat check, the minion takes the damage instead of you.\n\nSome actions have an Unstable Function entry, which you can use to add the unstable trait for a bigger benefit. If you’re unable to use unstable actions, you can still use the action normally, but you can’t use the unstable function.",

Occult eidolons usually form from the essence of a spirit that is unwilling or unable to pass on, and find refuge with a summoner to avoid becoming undead; these types of eidolons are known as phantoms. Each phantom eidolon has a connection to a particular emotion, such as the anger phantom and devotion phantom described in _Secrets of Magic_.\n\n**Primal** eidolons usually manifest from life essence.

If your proficiency rank is expert or better in Crafting, only creatures actively searching can find your snares. It works the same way with disabling a snare (if you're an expert in Crafting, only a creature that is trained in Thievery can use [Disable a Device](link_action_19625) to successfully disable your snare, and so on). You use the Crafting DC of the snare's creator for the DC to Disable a Device.

Body ikons accentuate a physical trait of your body and so can’t be stolen, disarmed, dispelled, or otherwise taken away. Weapon and worn ikons are tied to items of power. When you select one, you gain a non-[magical](link_trait_1504), level-0 item of your choice that matches its usage entry. Providence ensures you come across these items; you might be traveling along a path to find a spear in a tree that only you can dislodge, or you might awaken holding a gleaming sash you saw in your dreams.\n\nYour ikons can be etched with runes, upgraded, or otherwise modified as normal for items of their type. A body or worn ikon can have runes etched on it to apply to your unarmed attacks as though it were handwraps of mighty blows, though only one of your ikons can have these runes and no ikon can have both these and armor or weapon runes.\n\nIf you acquire a new item the ikon’s usage could apply to, you can switch your ikon to the new item by spending 1 day of downtime with the new ikon as you saturate the object with your divine energy. You can use this process to make an existing [magic](link_trait_1504) item, like a [cloak of illusions](link_item_6812) or a [searing blade](link_item_7744), into your ikon. If the item wasn’t already a [divine](link_trait_1475) item, it becomes one for as long as it is your ikon, removing the [arcane](link_trait_1459), [occult](link_trait_1514), [primal](link_trait_1454), or [magical](link_trait_1504) trait from the item and adding the [divine](link_trait_1475) trait.

This takes an amount of time listed in the clockwork's wind-up entry, which also lists how long the clockwork remains operational once wound; after this duration, the clockwork becomes inactive and immobile until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most are re-wound approximately halfway through their operating time.\n\nA clockwork vehicle can be placed into standby mode by its pilot as a 3-action activity; a clockwork creature must perform this activity itself. A clockwork's operational time doesn't decrease in standby.\n\nA creature can attempt to [Disable a Device](link_action_19625) to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry). For each success, a clockwork vehicle loses 10 minutes of operational time, while a clockwork creature loses 1 hour.

In addition to the effects of high gravity (see below), a character takes minor to moderate bludgeoning damage per minute.\n\n### **High Gravity**\n\nAn environment with high gravity will be oppressive for most creatures. A character (and their gear) weighs twice as much as in a normal gravity environment, but their attributes stay the same. Such characters move at half speed (minimum 5 feet), can jump only half as high or as far, and can carry and lift only half as much. High gravity also reduces the ranges of thrown weapons by half. Fatigue High gravity reduces the time it takes for characters to become fatigued from overland travel to only 2 hours. Characters who spend more than a day in a high gravity\n\n### **Normal Gravity**\n\nAn environment with normal gravity has conditions similar to planets like Earth or lost Golarion and has no effect on most characters.\n\n### **Low Gravity**\n\nAn environment with low gravity is liberating for creatures accustomed to normal or higher gravity. A character can jump twice as high and as far, can lift or carry twice their normal amount, and doubles the range of thrown weapons.\n\n### **Zero Gravity**\n\nEnvironments such as outer space and some small satellites have zero gravity (also referred to as zero-g). Creatures in zero-g have the clumsy, off-guard, and untethered conditions. A creature in a zero gravity environment can lift and carry 10 times their normal amount and multiplies the ranges of thrown weapons by 10.\n\n#### **Movement in Zero Gravity**\n\nCreatures in a zero-g environment float aimlessly without a method of propulsion or holding on to an object. Creatures that fly via methods that require an atmosphere, such as wings, can’t use their fly Speeds in zero-g. Creatures flying with some other method of propulsion, such as jetpacks, starship thrusters, and spells like fly or void vessel, are unaffected.

A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target’s active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target’s abilities that are purely physical, and it can’t use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target’s attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack roll, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor’s invested items apply when using its own values, and the target’s invested items apply when using the target’s values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn’t in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body.

If a spellcaster wants to transfer their spells from one of their spellbooks to a grimoire, they can conduct a simple, 1-minute ritual with the two books to cause the spells to vanish from their spellbook and appear in the grimoire.\n\nIf you prepare spells (whether from your class features, like a [cleric](link_class_22) or [wizard](link_class_26), or from a special feat or ability, like the [Esoteric Polymath](link_feat_20118) bard feat), you can study a grimoire during your daily preparations to enhance one or more of the spells within. Until your next daily preparations, you gain the ability to Activate the grimoire. As you've already absorbed the power from the grimoire during your daily preparations, you can Activate it even if you later lose possession of the book itself. Grimoires' benefits apply only to spells cast via spell slots—not cantrips, focus spells, or innate spells.
