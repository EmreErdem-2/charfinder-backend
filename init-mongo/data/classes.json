        "description": "> _Some rangers believe civilization wears down the soul, but still needs to be protected from wild creatures. Others say nature needs to be protected from the greedy, who wish to tame its beauty and plunder its treasures. You could champion either goal, or both. You might be a scout, tracker, or hunter of fugitives or beasts, haunting the edge of civilization or exploring the wilds. You know how to live off the land and are skilled at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou can single out particular foes to hunt, making you better at defeating them. You target and brutalize your chosen foe with either a bow or melee weapons, while supporting your allies with your skills.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nWhen you speak, it's with the voice of practical experience, especially involving wilderness exploration.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou guide your allies through the wilderness or follow tracks. You keep an eye out for trouble, constantly alert for danger even when it's not overt.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou craft weapons and train animals in preparation for your next venture. If you prefer to get outside, you might go on hunts or scout nearby areas to better understand your environment.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Respect the raw power of nature and understand how to make the best of its bounty.\n    \n*   Enjoy the thrill of the hunt.\n    \n*   Scout out ahead of the party, reconnoitering dangers before combat begins.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Call upon you to protect them from the wilds or the encroachment of civilization.\n    \n*   Expect you to be a quiet or taciturn loner.\n    \n*   Think there is something dangerous and wild about you.",

If you're a cloistered cleric, you primarily cast spells. Most of your spells can boost, protect, or heal your allies. Depending on your deity, you get extra spells to heal your allies or harm your enemies.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou might make diplomatic overtures or deliver impressive speeches. Because you're wise, you also pick up on falsehoods others tell.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou detect nearby magic and interpret any religious writing you come across. You might also concentrate on a protective spell for your allies in case of attack. After a battle or hazard, you might heal anyone who was hurt.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou might perform services at a temple, travel to spread the word of your deity, research scripture, celebrate holy days, or even found a new temple.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Visit the temples and holy places sacred to your faith, and have an immediate affinity with other worshippers of your deity.\n    \n*   Know the teachings of your religion's holy texts and how they apply to a dilemma.\n    \n*   Cooperate with your allies, provided they don't ask you to go against divine will.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Find your devotion impressive, even if they don't understand it.\n    \n*   Expect you to heal their wounds.\n    \n*   Rely on you to interact with other religious figures.",

You combine your actions through clever combinations of opening moves, finishing strikes, and counterattacks whenever your foes are unwise enough to drop their guard. Whether you are a knight, mercenary, sharpshooter, or blade master, you have honed your martial skills into an art form and perform devastating critical attacks on your enemies._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou strike with unmatched accuracy and use specialized combat techniques. A melee fighter stands between allies and enemies, attacking foes who try to get past. A ranged fighter delivers precise shots from a distance.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou can be an intimidating presence. This can be useful when negotiating with enemies, but is sometimes a liability in more genteel interactions.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou keep up your defenses in preparation for combat, and keep an eye out for hidden threats. You also overcome physical challenges in your way, breaking down doors, lifting obstacles, climbing adeptly, and leaping across pits.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou might perform manual labor or craft and repair armaments. If you know techniques you no longer favor, you might train yourself in new ones. If you've established your reputation, you might build an organization or a stronghold of your own.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Know the purpose and quality of every weapon and piece of armor you own.\n    \n*   Recognize that the danger of an adventurer's life must be balanced out with great revelry or ambitious works.\n    \n*   Have little patience for puzzles or problems that require detailed logic or study.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Find you intimidating until they get to know you—and maybe even after they get to know you.\n    \n*   Expect you're all brawn and no brains.\n    \n*   Respect your expertise in the art of warfare and value your opinion on the quality of armaments.",

It can bring ruin to the stoutest fortress in minutes, reducing even the mightiest works to rubble, burning them to ash, burying them beneath an avalanche of snow, or drowning them beneath the waves. It can provide endless bounty and breathtaking splendor to those who respect it—and an agonizing death to those who take it too lightly. You are one of those who hear nature's call. You stand in awe of the majesty of its power and give yourself over to its service._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou call upon the forces of nature to defeat your enemies and protect your allies. You cast spells that draw upon primal magic to protect yourself and your friends, heal their wounds, or summon deadly animals to fight at your side. Depending on your bond to nature, you might call upon powerful elemental magic or change shape into a terrifying beast.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou represent balance and a reasoned approach to problems, looking for solutions that not only are best for the natural world, but also allow the creatures within it to live in harmony and peace. You often propose compromises that allow both sides to gain what they truly need, even if they can't have all that they desire.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYour nature skills are invaluable. You track down enemies, navigate the wilderness, and use spells to detect magical auras around you. You might even ask wild animals to lend their extraordinary senses and scouting abilities to your group.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou might craft magic items or potions. Alternatively, your tie to nature might lead you to tend a wilderness area, befriending beasts and healing the wounds caused by civilization. You might even teach sustainable farming and animal husbandry techniques that allow others to subsist off the land without harming the natural balance.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Have a deep and meaningful respect for the power of nature.\n    \n*   Be in constant awe of the natural world, eager to share it with others but wary of their influence upon it.\n    \n*   Treat plants and animals as allies, working with them to reach your goals.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   View you as a representative of nature, and are sure you can control it.\n    \n*   Assume you're a recluse who avoids society and cities and prefers to live in the wild.\n    \n*   Consider you a mystic, similar to a priest, but answering only to the forces of nature.",

While the path of every rogue is unique and riddled with danger, the one thing you all share in common is the breadth and depth of your skills._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou move about stealthily so you can catch foes unawares. You're a precision instrument, more useful against a tough boss or distant spellcaster than against rank-and-file soldiers.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYour skills give you multiple tools to influence your opposition. Pulling cons and ferreting out information are second nature to you.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou sneak to get the drop on foes and scout for danger or traps. You're a great asset, since you can disable traps, solve puzzles, and anticipate dangers.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou might pick pockets or trade in illegal goods. You can also become part of a thieves' guild, or even found one of your own.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Hone your skills through intense practice, both on your own and out in the world.\n    \n*   Know where to attain illicit goods.\n    \n*   Skirt or break the law because you think it's meaningless or have your own code.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Find you charming or fascinating, even if they think they know better than to trust you.\n    \n*   Come to you when they need someone who is willing to take risks or use questionable methods.\n    \n*   Suspect you're motivated primarily by greed.",

You treat magic like a science, cross-referencing the latest texts on practical spellcraft with ancient tomes to discover and understand arcane magic. Yet magical theory is vast, and there’s no way you can study it all. Most wizards learn through formal schooling, with their curriculum informing a specific rubric, although particularly driven researchers sometimes piece together their own theories._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou likely try to stay out of the fray, carefully judging when to use your spells. You save your most powerful magic to incapacitate threatening foes and use your cantrips when only weaker foes remain. When enemies pull out tricks like invisibility or flight, you answer with spells like _revealing light_ or _earthbind_, leveling the field for your allies.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou provide a well of knowledge about arcane matters and solve arguments with logic.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou locate magical auras and determine the arcane significance of magical writing or phenomena you uncover. When you run across an unusual obstacle to further exploration, you probably have a scroll that will make it easier to overcome.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou learn new spells, craft magic items, or scribe scrolls for your party, and seek out new and exciting formulas in addition to spells. You might even forge scholarly connections and establish a school or guild of your own.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Have an unquenchable intellectual curiosity about how everything in the world around you works—magic in particular.\n    \n*   Believe fervently that your school of magic is superior (if you’re a specialist) or that true mastery of magic requires knowledge of all schools (if you’re a universalist).\n    \n*   Use esoteric jargon and technical terms to precisely describe the minutiae of magical effects, even though the difference is probably lost on other people.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Consider you to be incredibly powerful and potentially dangerous.\n    \n*   Fear what your magic can do to their minds, bodies, and souls, and ask that you avoid casting spells in polite company, as few can identify whether one of your spells is harmless or malevolent until it’s too late.\n    \n*   Assume you can easily solve all their problems, from dangerous weather to poor crop yields, and ask you for spells that can help them get whatever they desire.",

You might try to learn more about your patron, their aims, or your own powers, and you might seek out the company of other witches for collaboration or community.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Strive to learn more about your patron or familiar, your patron's goals, why they chose to empower you, and how you fit into their plans.\n    \n*   Seek out new sources of magic, like scrolls and spellbooks, to supplement the spells your patron provides.\n    \n*   View your familiar as a steadfast ally, a dear friend, or a necessary nuisance, depending on its personality.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Wonder about the nature of your patron and the source of your magic, worrying you'll turn on them or that you unknowingly serve to a foul power.\n    \n*   Appreciate your ability to aid them with magic, whether you do so by helping them directly or by hampering their adversaries.\n    \n*   Take care not to offend you, fearful that you'll place a malicious hex on them if you're angered.",

Using powerful performances, you influence minds and elevate souls to new levels of heroics. You might use your powers to become a charismatic leader, or perhaps you might instead be a counselor, manipulator, scholar, scoundrel, or virtuoso. While your versatility leads some to consider you a beguiling ne'er-do-well and a jack-of-all-trades, it's dangerous to dismiss you as a master of none._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou use magical performances to alter the odds in favor of your allies. You confidently alternate between attacks, healing, and helpful spells as needed.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou persuade, prevaricate, and threaten with ease.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou're a font of knowledge, folktales, legends, and lore that provide a deeper context and helpful reconnaissance for the group's adventure. Your spells and performances inspire your allies to greater discovery and success.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou can earn money and prestige with your performances, gaining a name for yourself and acquiring patrons. Eventually, tales of your talents and triumphs might attract other bards to study your techniques in a bardic college.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Have a passion for your art so strong that you forge a spiritual connection with it.\n    \n*   Take point when tact and nonviolent solutions are required.\n    \n*   Follow your muse, whether it's a mysterious fey creature, a philosophical concept, a psychic force, or a deity of art or music, and with its aid learn secret lore that few others have.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Relish the opportunity to invite you to social events, either as a performer or a guest, but consider you to be something of a curiosity in their social circles.\n    \n*   Underestimate you compared to other spellcasters, believing you are little more than a foppish minstrel and overlooking the subtle power of your magic.\n    \n*   Respond favorably to your social charm and abilities, but remain suspicious of your beguiling magic.",

While champions exist for every alignment, as a champion of good, you provide certainty and hope to the innocent. You have powerful defenses that you share freely with your allies and innocent bystanders, as well as holy power you use to end the threat of evil. Your devotion even attracts the attention of holy spirits who aid you on your journey._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou confront enemies in hand-to-hand combat while carefully positioning yourself to protect your allies.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou are a voice of hope, striving to reach a peaceful solution that strengthens bonds and yields good results for all.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou overcome barriers both physical and spiritual, providing inspiration to your allies through your actions and—when your fellow adventurers ask for it—providing moral and ethical guidance.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou spend much of your time in solemn prayer and contemplation, rigorous training, charity work, and fulfilling the tenets of your code, but that doesn't mean there isn't time to take up a craft or hobby.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Believe there is always hope that good will triumph over evil, no matter how grim the odds.\n    \n*   Know the ends don't justify the means, since evil acts increase the power of evil.\n    \n*   Have a strong sense of right and wrong, and grow frustrated when greed or shortsightedness breeds evil.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   See you as a symbol of hope, especially in a time of great need.\n    \n*   Worry you secretly despise them for not living up to your impossible standard, or that you are unwilling to compromise when necessary.\n    \n*   Know that you've sworn divine oaths of service they can trust you to keep.",

In response, you’ve scavenged the best parts of every magical tradition and built up a collection of esoterica—a broken holy relic here, a sprig of mistletoe there—that you can use to best any creature by exploiting their weaknesses and vulnerabilities. The mystic implement you carry is both badge and weapon, its symbolic weight helping you bargain with and subdue the supernatural. Every path to power has its restrictions and costs, but you turn them all to your advantage. You’re a thaumaturge, and you work wonders._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou use your implements and diverse arsenal of mystic tools and tricks to assist in combat, always presenting the right bane to exploit enemies' weaknesses or shield your allies against the supernatural.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou understand and nudge the social connections between people, much as you strive to understand the larger ties between mysteries and concepts. This helps you to find common ground when negotiating between the mundane and supernatural or even to play one side against the other.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou investigate unexplainable phenomena around you, taking appropriate precautions to ward yourself and your allies against paranormal threats. Where necessary, you create your own path through the unknown.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou research deeper into the supernatural mysteries you discovered on your last adventure to see how they can be applied in the future. You dust off relics, cultivate herbs, or forge trinkets, updating your collection of scavenged supernatural tools after each new threat you encounter. You return or call in favors with other people, strange creatures, and mystical forces.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Prepare for the worst while improvising as necessary, impressing your allies when you're able to handle anything that fate throws at you.\n    \n*   Assume everything is connected on a deeper level, rather than be content with what you find on the surface.\n    \n*   Obsess over a certain supernatural phenomenon, attempting to tie everything back to it.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Look to you to learn the weaknesses of a supernatural threat when one rears its head. Even when your explanations are invented on the fly, they just seem to work.\n    \n*   Rely on you to come up with a solution when the situation seems hopeless.\n    \n*   Mistake you for a common wizard or magician.",

While the thin line between your mind and reality means that a single errant thought could have unintended consequences for yourself and your companions, you know that anything is possible, if you can imagine it._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou rely on your collection of psychic cantrips as a mainstay, choosing where and when to amplify them for maximum effect. You weave your more conventional spells into the fray where more complex magic is needed, unleashing your mind's full potential in a blaze of power when the time is right.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou navigate situations guided by the source of your subconscious power. If your power springs from your personality, you might maneuver with empathy and sociability; if it's more cerebral, you might provide a steady logical front.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou keep your mind's eye open for the many paranormal threats that those who are less sensitive might not detect. Typically, you either scan for magic or investigate for psychic impressions, veiled thoughts, and wandering spirits.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou strive to learn more about the depths of the mind, seeking out new spells and phenomena to uncover, knowing that as you gain a deeper understanding of yourself, you can access more of the power within. You test the limits of your adaptability by retraining to fit your evolving understanding of your potential.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Show a preference for learning, meditation, dreams, or other intangible manifestations of thought over the immediacy of the physical world.\n    \n*   Learn new things about yourself, just when you thought you knew it all.\n    \n*   Think of your psychic magic as so much a part of you that you use it even when normal methods suffice, perhaps preferring to communicate via mental messages or levitating an object to a companion at the opposite end of a table.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Are awed by your mental abilities, especially when your psyche is unleashed.\n    \n*   Have difficulty understanding that the magic you perform with your mind comes from the same source as more conventional spellcasting\n    \n*   Wonder if you might be a monster in disguise, possessed by spirits, chosen by the gods, or have some other unusual reason for your strange powers.",

You understand the great mysteries of the universe embodied in overarching concepts that transcend good and evil or chaos and law, whether because you perceive the common ground across multiple deities or circumvent their power entirely. You explore one of these mysteries and draw upon its power to cast miraculous spells, but that power comes with a terrible price: a curse that grows stronger the more you draw upon it. Your abilities are a double-edged sword, which you might uphold as an instrument of the divine or view as a curse from the gods._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou draw upon your mystery to empower yourself in combat, balancing miraculous effects with the increasing severity of your curse as conflicting divine demands overtax your physical body. You cast spells to aid your allies and devastate your foes, or depending on your mystery, you might wade into battle yourself.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou rely upon the insights drawn from your mystery. You might leverage your curse to intimidate people or hide its effects to better blend in.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou recenter yourself to bring the terrible metaphysical conflicts causing your curse back under control so you can draw upon your mystery's power again later. You remain aware of supernatural forces acting around you, perhaps peeking into the future to gain insights.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou might seek to learn more about your mystery and the divine wellsprings that fuel your power. Associating with others interested in the subject of your mystery can make it easier to live with your curse. You could associate with an organized religion or even start your own faithful following devoted to your mystery.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   View your oracular powers as a blessing, a curse, or both.\n    \n*   Push yourself to the limits of what you can withstand to work great acts of magic.\n    \n*   Rely on magical items to provide a pool of safer and more reliable magic.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Don't realize your spellcasting draws upon divine power and instead believe you command stranger—and possibly evil—powers.\n    \n*   Assume you performed some terrible transgression to become cursed by the gods.\n    \n*   Admire your determination and the sacrifices you make to perform wondrous acts.",

You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your swashbuckler's style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou are equally likely to charm or intimidate others—or both. You might be an adept socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do the talking.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always prepared to leap into action with bravado and flair. You interact with the environment in bold, sweeping strokes rather than skulking to avoid detection.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou might carouse at the tavern, repair and maintain your armaments, or train to learn new techniques. To maintain your impressive reputation, you might build an organization in your name or establish a following of admirers.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Portray yourself as a heroic daredevil or a roguish braggart, knowing you can live up to the image you present.\n    \n*   Hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your reputation.\n    \n*   Practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow rusty.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade.\n    \n*   Find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your style.\n    \n*   Underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of your deadly blade.",

A kinetic gate inextricably tied to your body channels power directly from the elemental planes, causing elements to leap to your hand, whirl around your body, and blast foes at your whim. As your connection to the planes grows, you attain true mastery over your chosen elements._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nElemental magic surges from you throughout the fight. Without any restrictions on how often you can use your abilities, you become a reliable slinger of magic. You can develop powers you can use in a variety of situations… or you can choose just a few favorite attacks you use repeatedly.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nThe elements you channel might guide or even influence how you carry yourself in social situations. You might leap to anger like a raging fire stand your ground as solid as a mountain, keep your motives elusive as the wind, go with the flow like water, make cutting remarks sharp as metal, or exhibit the slow patience of the forest.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYour innate connection to the elements hones your awareness of the natural world. In an environment full of an element you can channel, you're unparalleled, with the ability to repeatedly manipulate the element around you.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou could commune with the elements or practice your control over your kineticist powers. Through retraining, you can realign the flow of your kinetic gate to perfect different manifestations of your element.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Have a conflicted relationship with the kinetic gate that fuels your kineticist magic, possibly because it manifested at a traumatic point in your past.\n    \n*   Struggle with controlling and understanding your elemental powers.\n    \n*   Form a kinship with elemental creatures or feel at home in areas strong with your element.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Find your ability to keep calling on more and more elemental power truly astonishing.\n    \n*   Defer to you in all matters related to your element, from the smallest tasks to the politics of the elemental planes.\n    \n*   Worry you'll consume yourself with elemental magic or lose control of its primal forces.",

Depending on your choice of weapon, you might prefer to strike your opponent from a hidden position before they ever realize you're there, dash through a frenzied melee with pistols blazing, or glide effortlessly across the battlefield, waiting for the perfect moment to end the conflict with a single, well-placed shot.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou have a keen eye and can see things coming from farther than most. You might not be the life of the party, but your companions know to pay attention when your subtle nod or concerned grunt indicates that something's amiss.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou scout the group's position for incoming threats and help search for secret doors and hidden passages, keeping a weather eye out for unexpected threats.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou might craft ammunition or keep your complex weapons clean and maintained, and you might look for work that matches your unique talents, such as working as a blacksmith, engineer, or part of the local watch. You might wander from town to town, or stay put for a spell to enjoy the silence that lingers between gunfights.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Seek out areas of great conflict where your unique choice of weaponry can help build your reputation.\n    \n*   Explore new horizons, trusting your honed senses and deadly weapon to keep you safe.\n    \n*   Demonstrate extensive knowledge about various types of guns and ammunition, along with curiosity about the latest in gun technology.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Assume that since you know how your gun works, you must also understand how to resolve other mechanical challenges.\n    \n*   Underestimate you at first glance, thinking you rely on your gun because you lack any other skills.\n    \n*   Respect your eternal vigilance, unyielding grit, and excellent aim.",

You usually feel more comfortable on the field of battle when you can more easily tell friend from foe, but that doesn't mean you can't bond with other soldiers or those who have had experiences similar to yours.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou remain vigilant against possible threats, ready to step up at a moment's notice to guard your allies. Constantly wearing armor has made you stronger, allowing you to surmount physical challenges such as moving heavy objects or scaling walls.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYour armor and shield might have gotten damaged during your latest adventures, so you often spend time repairing and maintaining them. You might also earn some extra coin doing manual labor or extra work as a town guard.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Stand firm in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, trusting in the strength of your armor to pull you through.\n    \n*   Good-naturedly joke about how the damage you've taken has effectively saved the lives of your companions.\n    \n*   Be slow to trust the motives of anyone who isn't one of your allies, assuming they mean to do you harm.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Appreciate the sturdiness of your armor, especially when it absorbs an attack meant for them.\n    \n*   Don't understand why you'd want to put yourself in danger by taunting enemies.\n    \n*   Feel safer when you are standing beside them on the field of battle.",

You may have trained in classical theories of warfare and strategy at a military school or you might have refined your techniques through hard-won experience as part of an army or mercenary company. Regardless of how you came by your knowledge, you have a gift for signaling your allies from across the battlefield and shouting commands to rout even the most desperate conflicts, allowing your squad to exceed their limits and claim victory._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou look for an advantageous position to survey the battlefield, shouting out instructions to your allies or signaling them with your personal banner based on the tactics you've trained and drilled beforehand.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou leverage your keen intellect and knowledge of warfare to watch for hostile political ploys and ferret out information your rivals would rather keep hidden.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou use your keen perception, trained across multiple battlefields, to watch for ambushes and plan tactics that are useful for your current environment.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou make connections with soldiers and aristocrats alike, leveraging your connections to find promising prospects for work. You might enjoy board games like chess, draj, go, imperial conquest, or other games of tactics as ways to keep yourself sharp in times of peace.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Hold yourself to an incredibly high standard of personal responsibility, chastising yourself for small mistakes that others don't even notice.\n    \n*   Take the lead in discussions or negotiations instinctively, trusting your keen mind to prevail where your personality might not.\n    \n*   Constantly strive to learn more about your allies so you can bring out the best in them.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Respect your knowledge and opinion, especially when taking the broad view of a situation.\n    \n*   Sometimes consider you to be too bossy or demanding.\n    \n*   Underestimate your cunning, especially if they're a scholar or other academic unfamiliar with the rigorous study required to obtain your tactical knowledge.",

You delight in wreaking havoc and using powerful weapons to carve through your enemies, relying on astonishing durability without needing complicated techniques or rigid training. Your rages draw upon a vicious instinct, which you might associate with an animal, a spirit, or some part of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to hold back the storm of emotions inside them and release their rage only when it matters most._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou summon your rage and rush to the front lines to smash your way through. Offense is your best defense—you'll need to drop foes before they can exploit your relatively low defenses.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou use intimidation to get what you need, especially when gentler persuasion can't get the job done.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou look out for danger, ready to rush headfirst into battle in an instant. You climb the challenging rock wall and drop a rope for others to follow, and you wade into the risky currents to reach the hidden switch beneath the water's surface. If something needs breaking, you're up to the task!\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou might head to a tavern to carouse, build up the fearsome legend of your mighty deeds, or recruit followers to become a warlord in your own right.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Have a deep-seated well of anger, hatred, or frustration.\n    \n*   Prefer a straightforward approach to one requiring patience and tedium.\n    \n*   Engage in a regimen of intense physical fitness.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Rely on your courage and your strength, and trust that you can hold your own in a fight.\n    \n*   See you as uncivilized or a boorish lout unfit for high society.\n    \n*   Believe that you are loyal to your friends and allies and will never relent until the fight is done.",

You might leverage your curse to intimidate people or hide its effects to better blend in.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou recenter yourself to bring the terrible metaphysical conflicts causing your curse back under control so you can draw upon your mystery's power again later.

        "description": "> _You didn't choose to become a spellcaster—you were born one. There's magic in your blood. Perhaps a divine influence blessed one of your ancestors, a forebear communed with an ancient, primordial entity, or a powerful occult ritual performed long ago influenced your lineage. Self-reflection and study allow you to refine your inherent magical skills and unlock new, more powerful abilities. The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face the choice of whether you'll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper their movements. You might be too vulnerable to leap directly into melee combat, or your bloodline might give you abilities that help you hold your own in a brawl. While your magic is strong, you also rely on cantrips in order to conserve your more powerful spells for the right moment (or after you've used such spells up).\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYour natural charisma makes you good at interacting with people.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou detect the magic around you, finding treasures and warning your adventuring group of magical traps. When the group encounters mysteries or problems related to your bloodline, you try to solve them.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou craft magic items or scribe scrolls. Your bloodline might drive you to research your ancestry or associate with affiliated people or creatures.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject your magical heritage, you long to distinguish yourself both as a spellcaster and as an individual.\n    \n*   View your lineage with fascination, fear, or something in between—anything from wholehearted acceptance to vehement rejection.\n    \n*   Rely on magic items, such as scrolls and wands, to supplement your limited selection of spells.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Marvel at your ability to create magic from thin air and view your abilities with equal parts admiration and mistrust.\n    \n*   Consider you less dedicated than studious wizards, devoted clerics, and other practitioners of magic, since power comes to you naturally.\n    \n*   Assume you're as unpredictable as the magic you bring forth, even if your personality proves otherwise.",

You usually stay toward the outside of the group to protect more vulnerable members, and you're well suited to looking for danger or moving stealthily.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou diligently exercise, eat healthy foods, meditate, and study various philosophies. You might also take up a craft that you strive to perfect.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Maintain a regimen of physical training and meditation.\n    \n*   Face adversity with a calm and measured approach, never panicking or\n    \n    succumbing to despair.\n    \n*   Look to the future for ways you can improve, while remaining at peace\n    \n    with your present self.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Marvel at your feats of physical prowess.\n    \n*   Think you're more than a bit uptight, given your vows and tenets.\n    \n*   Come to you for philosophical advice.",

You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your swashbuckler's style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou are equally likely to charm or intimidate others—or both. You might be an adept socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do the talking.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always prepared to leap into action with bravado and flair. You interact with the environment in bold, sweeping strokes rather than skulking to avoid detection.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou might carouse at the tavern, repair and maintain your armaments, or train to learn new techniques and stunts. To maintain your impressive reputation, you might build an organization in your name or establish a following of admirers.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Portray yourself as a heroic daredevil or a roguish braggart, knowing you can live up to the image you present.\n    \n*   Hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your reputation.\n    \n*   Practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow rusty.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade.\n    \n*   Find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your flamboyant style.\n    \n*   Underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of your deadly blade.",

The powers of gravity and light represent the extremes of these forces, and you can attune yourself between them. As an agent of this cycle, you manifest an array of solar equipment, and use your own connection to stellar forces to empower them. Regardless of which extreme of the stellar spectrum you prefer, you can change your attunement between them to take advantage of bespoke powers earned through hard meditation and practice.\n\n### During Combat Encounters...\n\nYou get into the thick of things, getting close to foes and attacking with your manifestations. You shift between battlefield control and close attacks, depending on your current solar attunement.\n\n### During Social Encounters...\n\nYour stellar arrangement helps determine how you act in social circles. You might be a chatterbox who makes friends easily or use lies or displays of your abilities to cow those around you.\n\n### While Exploring...\n\nYou want to be near the front of the group to quickly get into the fight. You want to overcome challenges, like moving debris, climbing strange terrain, or otherwise maneuvering in alien environments.\n\n### Downtime...\n\nYou balance your downtime between necessary meditations and using your skills for labor. You might also create your own dedicated following and build a monastery to train a new generation of solarians.\n\n### You Might...\n\n*   Meditate to find an answer to a specific issue, thinking through possible eventualities before deciding on the correct course of action.\n    \n*   Surprise others with cunning uses of your stellar abilities, performing feats that others weren’t expecting or knew you could do.\n    \n\n### Others Probably...\n\n*   Expect you to bore them with constant talk of stars and cosmic phenomena.\n    \n*   Have some jealousy of your powers and the strange feats you can achieve without the use of magic.\n    \n*   Think you’ll be the voice of reason in a group.",

You’ve learned to focus on an anchoring memory, concept, or object to help you identify reality\n\n### During Combat Encounters...\n\nYou reshape terrain and manipulate events to match alternate realities. You cast powerful spells or recenter yourself through your anchor when you’ve pushed your power past the limit.\n\n### During Social Encounters...\n\nYou might solve problems with deductive reasoning or by determining mathematic probabilities, drawing on your deep, mystic knowledge of the multiverse.\n\n### While Exploring...\n\nYou seek magical auras and provide guidance regarding supernatural phenomena you encounter. You might use spell gems to bypass obstacles and protect yourself from dangerous environments\n\n### Downtime...\n\nYou learn new spells, craft magic items, or imbue spell gems for your party.

You’re a leader who motivates your teammates, pushes them past their limits, and helps them through tough spots. You excel at getting others to do what you want, but you’re always ready to face trouble head on when things take a turn for the worse. You might be a con artist, diplomat, performer, or even a military officer—or you might take on whatever role the situation demands.\n\n### During Combat Encounters...\n\nYou issue directives to your team, granting benefits if they follow your lead. Your words and deeds bolster your allies or harry your foes, and your cunning can get you and your team out of danger.\n\n### During Social Encounters...\n\nYou are often the face for your team, whether you use diplomacy, lies, threats, or whatever words it takes to get your way.\n\n### While Exploring...\n\nYou readily adapt to new situations and excel at motivating your team to overcome obstacles.\n\n### In Downtime...\n\nYou look for new opportunities to make a name for yourself, work your way up through the ranks of an organization, or establish an enterprise of your own.\n\n### You Might...\n\n*   Aspire to lead a business or military organization, or captain a starship.\n    \n*   Have friends—and enemies—in unexpected places.\n    \n*   Look for opportunities to talk your way out of fights.\n    \n\n### Others Probably...\n\n*   Find you likable, or at least respect you.\n    \n*   Ask for your help navigating complex social situations.\n    \n*   Assume you like being in charge.",

You bond with spirits, manifesting their distinct magic and allowing their knowledge to flow through you. You may favor apparitions that grant you healing magic, others that grant you spells of destructive power, or pick and choose between different apparitions as your environment and circumstances demand. You may consider your powers part of a sacred trust or see your unique abilities as a sign that you’ve been chosen as a champion of two worlds. Whether you advocate for mortals in the planes beyond or whether you represent the spirits’ interests, you provide the bridge between realms._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou channel the power of spiritual entities called apparitions to cast potent spells and manipulate the battlefield to your advantage. You mix divine magic and the spells granted to you by your attuned apparitions to cast down your enemies or sustain your allies.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou watch and listen, letting the whispers of spirits and otherworldly beings guide you toward sound judgment.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou use your patient attention to detail, alongside clues and special senses gifted to you by your spiritual allies, to detect threats before they can ambush your companions or to notice hidden treasures that others might pass by.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou seek out areas close to otherworldly entities who bring you strength or comfort. You might tend to grave sites, tread primeval wildernesses, or ride the rivers and seas. Animists attuned to apparitions of wisdom and knowledge may spend their quiet hours in libraries or temples.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Talk to spiritual entities only you can perceive.\n    \n*   Prefer to speak in stories and descriptive anecdotes.\n    \n*   Look at the world from a broader or more metaphorical perspective than most mortal creatures.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Find you detached or absent-minded due to your focus on things beyond their awareness.\n    \n*   Value your wisdom as someone with access to vast troves of experience beyond what a single person could normally accumulate.\n    \n*   Mistake you for being cruel or lacking empathy because you give equal weight to the material and immaterial.",

When an arrow strikes your skin, it stings no more than a flea; when your spear strikes forward, it can pierce gods.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou naturally cut a larger-than-life figure. You may use your personal magnetism to inspire others, or you might be a lone and brooding figure who seldom speaks. Either way, your actions and words hang in the air with weight.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou feel for the flow of fate, knowing that your path will bring you to your next quest. You may take special interest in certain aspects of nature, society, or the cosmos as your divine spark begins to find itself drawn to certain powers.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nInactivity rarely suits an exemplar, so you seek out additional deeds or quests to spread your name. You might search for creatures to slay, compete in athletic contests, or quest for lost artifacts.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Chase glory across the land, beyond the sea, and over the horizon.\n    \n*   Take other heroes under your wing, that your legend may live on through them.\n    \n*   Feel the weight of immense expectations and obligation.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Look to you in times of crisis, thinking you can handle any challenge.\n    \n*   Think of you as larger than life, more of the figure of a story than a living adventurer.\n    \n*   Mistake your heroism and capability for pride and aloofness.",

Despite this, death and decay are considered subjects of the macabre, and those willing to dive headfirst into the fascinations they invoke are necromancers. These occult spellcasters seek the ever-changing borders of life and death, manipulating the energies—vitality and void—to suit their will. The undead both serve and cower before them. While a necromancer’s creations are merely a mockery of life, the undead are keen to serve their creator._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou manipulate the flow of life and death on the battlefield. You both create and destroy your undead servants to amplify your occult magics. You also tip the scale by draining the life of your foes to heal your allies.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYour knowledge of the occult and macabre can be both insightful and frightening. When natural charm fails, your magic can be just as potent at manipulating the living as it is the dead.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou can locate haunts and other magical traps. Perhaps you summon the undead to trigger a trap you spotted or to serve as a decoy when you think enemies might be near.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou can brew, craft magic items, or scribe scrolls for your party, and seek out knowledge about your grim fascination. Perhaps you tend to the local graveyard to ensure the dead are properly put to rest.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Have a feverish desire to study the anatomy of creatures you discover along your journey.\n    \n*   Pay respects for the dead and the death you cause while understanding it is the inevitable end of all living creatures.\n    \n*   Seek ways to cheat the natural order of life and death either to make yourself immortal or bring back a loved one.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Assume you enjoy the cruelty of death and revel in decay.\n    \n*   Seek you out hoping you can send or receive a message from a someone who has passed.\n    \n*   Ignore you, as your existence is a reminder that they and everyone they know will someday die.",

Equal parts scholar and artist, you devote yourself to the study of these mystic symbols, learning to carve, etch, brand, and paint the building blocks of magic to channel powers greater than yourself._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou make a canvass of the battlefield, tracing beneficial runes onto your allies to strengthen and empower them while looking for opportunities to carve harmful runes onto those who oppose you. When the moment is right, you invoke your runes to bring their magic to life.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYour knowledge of magical theory—if not practice—can translate into a surprising array of facts for any dialogue. Even if you’re not the most persuasive, you might be able to support a more eloquent teammate with a subtly placed runic enchantment.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou study ancient inscriptions on temple walls or lost artifacts to glean their history and forewarn your party. You take time to maintain runic inscriptions on your allies’ gear, ensuring they’ll be ready for the next encounter.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou balance scholarly magical research with an ardent practice of your craft. You may begin each morning composing a poem or spend each afternoon toiling at a forge, your understanding of runes growing day by day.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Pull from your study of languages and scripts in everyday conversation, using the odd word or maxim in an ancient language when the common tongue doesn’t quite suffice.\n    \n*   Personalize your magic items with small phrases or engravings that hold personal meaning.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Ask for your assistance when a necklace clasp needs fixing or their armor needs resizing.\n    \n*   Think you a practitioner of magic, instead of just a humble scholar.",

You're a leader who motivates your teammates, pushes them past their limits, and helps them through tough spots. You excel at getting others to do what you want, but you're always ready to face trouble head-on when things take a turn for the worse. You might be a con artist, diplomat, performer, or military officer—or you might take on whatever role the situation demands.\n\n#### During Combat Encounters…\n\nYou issue directives to your allies, granting benefits and letting you take the lead. Your words and deeds bolster your allies or harry your foes, and your cunning can get you and your team out of danger.\n\n#### During Social Encounters…\n\nYou're often the face for your team, whether you use diplomacy, lies, threats, or whatever words it takes to get your way.\n\n#### While Exploring…\n\nYou adapt to situations and excel at motivating your team to overcome obstacles.\n\n#### In Downtime…\n\nYou look for new opportunities to make a name for yourself, work your way up through the ranks of an organization, or establish an enterprise of your own.\n\n#### You Might…\n\n*   Aspire to lead a business or military organization, or captain a starship.\n    \n*   Have friends—and enemies—in unexpected places.\n    \n*   Look for opportunities to talk your way out of fights.\n    \n\n#### Others Probably…\n\n*   Like you, or at least respect you.\n    \n*   Ask for your help navigating complex social situations.\n    \n*   Assume you like being in charge.",

You can draw upon this supernatural wellspring to form deep spiritual bonds with your allies, empower them in combat, and restore their health should they become injured. Your powers take unique shape based on the connection you choose, granting new and more powerful spells as you explore your connection on a deeper level.\n\n#### During Combat Encounters…\n\nYou cast powerful spells that blast enemies and empower allies. You heal allies you share a bond with by drawing on your vitality network.\n\n#### During Social Encounters…\n\nYour connection shapes your perspective on the world and the way you approach problems. When a disagreement erupts between bonded members, you're often the one to help them talk through their problems.\n\n#### While Exploring…\n\nYou search for traces of magic and notice details relevant to your connection.\n\n#### In Downtime…\n\nYou reflect on your connection to deepen your understanding. You spend time with your bonded allies, perhaps working on the same side hustle, going on a hike together, or forming a guild in your favorite vidgame.\n\n#### You Might…\n\n*   Know more about the other members of your party than anyone else.\n    \n*   Have insights into the nature of your connection that others find unorthodox.\n    \n*   Have strange visions about fundamental forces.\n    \n\n#### Others Probably…\n\n1.  Think of you as the heart of your party.\n    \n2.  View your bond as a closed clique or think you're trying to recruit them.\n    \n3.  Assume you view the universe through the lens of your connection.",

The powers of gravity and light represent the extremes of these forces, and you can attune yourself between them. As an agent of this cycle, you manifest an array of solar equipment and use your own connection to stellar forces to empower them. Regardless of which extreme of the stellar spectrum you prefer, you can change your attunement between them to take advantage of solar powers earned through meditation and practice.\n\n#### During Combat Encounters…\n\nYou rush into the thick of things and attack with your solar manifestations. You shift between battlefield control and heavy attacks, depending on your current solar attunement.\n\n#### During Social Encounters…\n\nWhich solar aspect you prefer might influence how you act in social circles. You might be a chatterbox who makes friends easily or a smooth manipulator who uses your abilities to coerce people.\n\n#### While Exploring…\n\nYou likely stick near the front of the group to quickly get into the fight. You use your powers to overcome challenges, like moving debris or climbing strange terrain.\n\n#### In Downtime…\n\nYou balance your downtime between meditation and other activities. You might create your own dedicated following to train a new generation of solarians or use your flashy solarian powers to earn credits as a laborer or performer.\n\n#### You Might…\n\n*   Approach obstacles with caution or throw yourself headfirst at problems depending upon which attunement you favor.\n    \n*   Surprise others with cunning uses of your stellar abilities, performing acts that others weren't expecting or didn't know you could do.\n    \n*   Meditate or shadow spar constantly to perfect your techniques.\n    \n\n#### Others Probably…\n\n*   Expect you to bore them with constant talk of stars and cosmic phenomena.\n    \n*   Enjoy watching you fight or demonstrate your powers.\n    \n*   Think you'll be the voice of reason in a group.",

        "description": "> A strange paradoxical event forever altered your existence, and now you can manipulate reality. You explore the infinite possibilities of the multiverse, possibly visualizing variant timelines or parallel worlds. You create fields that subvert space and time, allowing you to cast powerful magic. You've learned to focus on an anchoring memory, concept, or object to help you identify reality.\n\n#### During Combat Encounters…\n\nYou reshape terrain and manipulate events to match other realities. You cast powerful spells and recenter yourself through your anchor when pushed to your limits.\n\n#### During Social Encounters…\n\nYou might solve problems with deductive reasoning or by determining mathematic probabilities, drawing on your deep knowledge of the multiverse.\n\n#### While Exploring…\n\nYou seek magical auras and provide guidance regarding supernatural phenomena you encounter while analyzing the environment around you. You might use spell gems to bypass obstacles and protect yourself from dangerous environments.\n\n#### In Downtime…\n\nYou craft magic items for your party. You might travel to other dimensions or distant star systems as part of your training or embark on such journeys by accident.\n\n#### You Might…\n\n*   Travel to distant destinations and hunt for secret knowledge.\n    \n*   Struggle to remain present without being distracted by all the possibilities.\n    \n*   Remember an encounter with bizarre forces that changed you.\n    \n\n#### Others Probably…\n\n*   Fear your abilities or worry your warps might be dangerous.\n    \n*   Dismiss your precognition or doubt your grip on your current reality.\n    \n*   Hope you can solve their problems by rewriting reality.",

You can even overclock your allies or yourself!\n\n### During Social Encounters...\n\nYou might enthusiastically babble about your topics of interest, speak only in cryptic messages in your programming language, or simply ignore conversation in favor of communing with computers or machine spirits in the area.\n\n### While Exploring...\n\nYou take note of magical and technological auras and objects. You’re an eager ambassador for synthetic lifeforms such as artificial intelligences, constructs, and other tech creatures—or you know exactly how to reprogram and control such beings.\n\n### In Downtime...\n\nYou craft new gear, upgrade your equipment, learn new spells, and research topics related to magic and technology. You might spend much of your free time surfing the infosphere, playing vidgames, or working in a tech-related field.\n\n### You Might...\n\n*   Have fluency in several magitech code languages and even create your own.\n    \n*   Make a living as a coder, engineer, or hacker.\n    \n*   Have the ultimate goal of hacking a planet, or reality itself.\n    \n\n### Others Probably...\n\n*   Don’t understand the esoteric conundrums and logic problems you enjoy solving, even when you take time to explain.\n    \n*   Hope you can revitalize their old technology or even program artificial intelligence into it.\n    \n*   Assume you know everything about magitech.",

You’re constantly crafting and modifying gear, whether that’s computers, explosives, tools, weapons, or items of your own design. You’ve constructed a sophisticated exocortex, a custom neural implant linking your own mind to your most complex creation: a robot companion, a weapon turret, or remote mines. If something’s broken—or needs breaking—you’re the one.\n\n### During Combat Encounters…\n\nYou use your exocortex to control remote mines, set up a turret in a key position, or command a drone to fight for you. You’re always ready with the right tactics and gear at the right time, and you alter your gear at a moment’s notice to tackle any type of foe or situation.\n\n### During Social Encounters…\n\nYou might think things through before speaking, bring up specific details that others miss, or talk to your drone.\n\n### While Exploring…\n\nYou position yourself to make the best use of your gear, especially your exocortex, always considering where you might place your mines, turret, or drone to have the greatest impact.\n\n### In Downtime…\n\nYou craft new gear, upgrade your equipment, practice new skills, or retrain into the skills and abilities most relevant to your current situation.\n\n### You Might...\n\nCarry extra gear to cover different situations. Have a unique way of interacting with technological creatures and devices. Enjoy finding unexpected uses for your equipment.\n\n### Others Might...\n\n*   Take note of how much attention you give to your exocortex and other gear.\n    \n*   Don’t understand how all your devices work, or get confused when you customize your gear in new ways.\n    \n*   Assume you know best when it comes to strange tech.",

        "description": "> _You approach battle with the knowledge that tactics and strategy are every bit as crucial as brute strength or numbers. You might have trained in classical theories of warfare and strategy at a military academy, or you might have refined your techniques through hard-won experience as part of an army or mercenary company. Regardless of how you came by your knowledge, you have a gift for signaling your allies from across the battlefield and deploying commands to rout even the most desperate conflicts, empowering your squad to exceed their limits and claim victory._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou look for an advantageous position to survey the battlefield, shouting out instructions to your allies or signaling them with your personal banner based on the tactics you’ve trained and drilled beforehand.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nYou leverage your keen intellect and knowledge of warfare to watch for hostile political ploys and ferret out information your rivals would rather keep hidden.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou use your keen perception, trained across multiple battlefields, to watch for ambushes and plan tactics that are useful for your current environment.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYou make connections with soldiers and aristocrats alike, leveraging your connections to find promising prospects for work. You might enjoy board games like chess, draj, go, imperial conquest, or other games of tactics as ways to keep yourself sharp in times of peace.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Take the lead in discussions or negotiations instinctively, trusting your keen mind to prevail and turn negotiations to your advantage.\n    \n*   Constantly strive to learn more about your allies so you can bring out the best in them.\n    \n*   Hold yourself to an incredibly high standard of personal responsibility, chastising yourself for small mistakes that others don’t even notice.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Respect your knowledge and opinion, especially when taking the broad view of a situation.\n    \n*   Sometimes consider you to be too bossy or demanding.\n    \n*   Underestimate your cunning, especially if they’re a scholar or other academic unfamiliar with the rigorous study required to obtain your tactical knowledge.",

But you are the shield, the steel wall that holds back the tide of opposition. You’re clad in armor you wear like a second skin and can angle it to protect yourself and your allies from damage and keep foes at bay. Allies look to you to safeguard them, whether they stand beside you on the battlefield or remain on the back lines, and enemies see you for the imposing threat you are. Be it to friend or foe, your presence is difficult to ignore._\n\n* * *\n\n### **During Combat Encounters…**\n\nYou’re unparalleled in your use of armor, squeezing every last drop of protection it offers. You take hits meant for your most vulnerable allies. You can also taunt your foes, drawing their ire and attention so they attack you instead of others.\n\n### **During Social Encounters…**\n\nDepending on your background, you might be friendly or coercive during negotiations. You usually feel more comfortable on the field of battle when you can more easily tell friend from foe, but that doesn’t mean you can’t bond with other soldiers or those who have had experiences similar to yours.\n\n### **While Exploring…**\n\nYou remain vigilant against possible threats, ready to step up at a moment’s notice. Constantly wearing armor has made you stronger, allowing you to surmount physical challenges such as moving heavy objects or scaling walls.\n\n### **In Downtime…**\n\nYour armor and shield might have gotten damaged during your latest adventures, so you often spend time repairing and maintaining them. You might also earn some extra coin doing manual labor or extra work as a town guard.\n\n### **You Might…**\n\n*   Stand firm in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, trusting in the strength of your armor to pull you through.\n    \n*   Good-naturedly joke about how the damage you’ve taken has effectively saved the lives of your companions.\n    \n*   Be slow to trust the motives of anyone who isn’t one of your allies, assuming they mean to do you harm.\n    \n\n### **Others Probably…**\n\n*   Appreciate the sturdiness of your armor, especially when it absorbs an attack meant for them.\n    \n*   Don’t understand why you’d want to put yourself in danger by taunting enemies.\n    \n*   Feel safer when you’re standing near them on the field of battle.",
